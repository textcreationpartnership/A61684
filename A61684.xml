            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT <hi>Religion</hi> hath a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>Excellency,</hi> is confeſſed more than once by the wiſeſt of Kings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 15. 4. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And would Men of the meaneſt <hi>Parts,</hi> and ſloweſt <hi>Conceptions</hi> deſiſt a little from the laborious purſuit of their ſinful pleaſures, and give their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> ſome intermiſſion, ſo much breath from that hot chaſe, as may qualifie them for a calm, conſiderate view of things; 'tis certain they would diſcern, that <hi>Vertue</hi> has a much more raviſhing appearance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb facs="tcp:48915:3"/> more delectable and enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, than all the <hi>Devils Opticks</hi> could put upon their moſt guſtful <hi>Senſualities.</hi> The great <hi>Advantages,</hi> that come to Mankind by <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> both to Humane <hi>Societies</hi> and Particular <hi>Perſons,</hi> beſpeak the tranſcendent <hi>Excellencies</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Religion</hi> brings great <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> to Humane <hi>Societies, Cities, Countries</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> I know ſome great Ones of the World have been jealous of the Kingdom of Chriſt, as <hi>Herod</hi> was troubled when he firſt heard of his Birth: yet others, who have followed the Dictates of natural Reaſon only, and been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly over-aw'd by a Deity, have look't upon it as a neceſſary <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to found Government upon, without which it can no more ſubſiſt than a Caſtle in the Air. I will mention two great <hi>Advantages</hi> that will come to Human <hi>Societies</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="tcp:48915:3"/> and wherein their Happineſs doth conſiſt, <hi>viz. Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi> Where theſe two are enjoy'd a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be miſerable, and where either of them is wanting they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Religion</hi> brings the Bleſſing of <hi>Peace</hi> along with it; and this is no mean <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Outward <hi>Peace</hi> is the chiefeſt of outward <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> it gives ſweetneſs and beauty to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bleſſings. The very Name of Peace is ſweet,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pronounceth that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy, who have it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 15. <hi>Happy is the People, that is in ſuch a caſe.</hi> Now this great <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is the product of <hi>Religion:</hi> And this it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth two ways. 1. By removing the Cauſes of Quarrels and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 2. By obliging Men to the obſervance of ſuch <hi>Precepts,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing into them ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> as naturally tend to Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:4"/> 1. By removing the Cauſes of Strifes and Contentions; and they are chiefly two: the Curſe of God upon them, and their own Luſts within them. 1. The feud and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, jars and quarrels among men are part of that Curſe, which lies upon Mankind for his Apoſtacy from God. We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. How the Ground was curſed for Mans ſake: <hi>Thorns and Thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee.</hi> But a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Curſe 'twas, that one Man ſhould become as a Thorn and Briar to fetch blood of another. Aſſoon as Man fell out with God, there was a Fire kindled at his own door, in his own nature. Now where <hi>Religion</hi> is cordially embraced, this cauſe of Quarrels and Contentions, the Curſe of God, is removed. 2. Their own Luſts within them. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:4"/> 
               <hi>not hence, even of your luſts, that war in your members?</hi> Luſt is the <hi>Make-bate</hi> in a Community: Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pride, paſſion, hatred, envy, intemperance, ambition—make Men quarrelſom and contentious. Now <hi>Religion</hi> mortifies theſe vile and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. Religion files off the ruggedneſs in mens ſpirits, removes the harſhneſs of their tempers, and extirpates all thoſe paſſions and vices, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men unſociable and troubleſom one to another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By obliging Men to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of ſuch <hi>Precepts,</hi> and infuſing into them ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tend to Peace. 1. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging men to the obſervance of ſuch <hi>Precepts,</hi> as have a natural tendency to the Peace of <hi>Human Societies.</hi> This is moſt clear from that one general Rule propounded by our Saviour (with which <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour
<pb facs="tcp:48915:5"/> was ſo taken, that he caus'd it to be written in his <hi>Palace,</hi> and other <hi>publick Places), Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would, that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> When we have to do with others, we muſt put our ſelves into their condition, and conſider how we ſhould deſire to be dealt with in ſuch a Caſe. Were this Precept of Chriſt generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, all Quarrels and Contentions would preſently ceaſe. How gently and tenderly would <hi>Superiors</hi> behave themſelves towards their <hi>Inferiors?</hi> And with how much reſpect &amp; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance would <hi>Inferiors</hi> carry themſelves towards their <hi>Superiors?</hi> The <hi>Rich</hi> would not with-hold from the <hi>Poor,</hi> nor the <hi>Poor</hi> by his idleneſs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily burdenſom to the <hi>Rich.</hi> The <hi>Lender</hi> would not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the neceſſity of the <hi>Borrower,</hi> nor the <hi>Borrower</hi> ungratefully defraud the <hi>Lender.</hi> The <hi>Seller</hi> would not
<pb facs="tcp:48915:5"/> deceive or over-reach the <hi>Buyer,</hi> nor the <hi>Buyer</hi> under-value the Goods of the <hi>Seller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewiſe more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Precepts, that have a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to preſerve and promote Peace among men; as <hi>That we muſt forgive wrongs, love our Enemies, keep in our places, mind our own buſineſs, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our preſent ſtate</hi> &amp;c. 2. By infuſing into men ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> as naturally incline to Peace; as <hi>love, ſelf-denyal, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs,—</hi>The <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaith, <hi>God created the Angels of light, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of the flame.</hi> Wicked men, who are like unto, and acted by the Devil, are furious and wrathful, all of a flame: But where <hi>Religion</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and prevails upon men, ther's light and love, coolneſs and calmneſs of temper. Grace ſmooths and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the moſt knotty piece; it turns the <hi>Vulture</hi> into a <hi>Dove,</hi> the <hi>Briar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:48915:6"/> a <hi>Myrtle-tree,</hi> the <hi>Lyon-like</hi> fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into a <hi>Lamb-like</hi> gentleneſs. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 11. 6<hi>—The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid: and the calf, and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. And the cow and the bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down together; and the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the ox. The ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aſp, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice den. They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is laid down the ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, who by the miniſtry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be ſubdued unto Chriſt, and become loyal Subjects of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom. O what a <hi>metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> doth it make! Thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were full of rage and fierceneſs, hereby become gentle and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:48915:6"/> Religion fills men with a ſpirit of univerſal love and good-will. And ſo much for the firſt great <hi>Advantage,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> brings to <hi>Human Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,</hi> the Bleſſing of Peace.</p>
            <p>2. Plenty is likwiſe the product of <hi>Religion;</hi> and that both Naturally and Morally: Naturally, as it makes men frugal, and temperate, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their Callings: Morally, as it brings the Bleſſing of God upon their enjoyments and undertakings, Levit. 26. 3<hi>—If ye walk in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; Then I will give you rain in due ſeaſon, and the land ſhall yield her increaſe. Again,</hi> Deut. 28. 2<hi>—All theſe bleſſings ſhall come on thee, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee, if thou ſhalt hearken vnto the voice of the Lord thy God. Bleſſed thou ſhalt be in the City, and bleſſed thou ſhalt be in the field—And</hi> ver. 8. <hi>The Lord ſhall command the bleſſing upon thee in thy ſtore-houſes, and in</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:7"/> 
               <hi>all that thou ſetteſt thine hand unto.</hi> Thus you ſee what <hi>Advantages</hi> come to <hi>Human Societies</hi> by Religion: it procures the choice <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> wherein their Happineſs doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>2. Let us in the ſecond place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how advantagious <hi>Religion</hi> is to particular <hi>Perſons;</hi> and in reference only to the Good things of this life <hi>viz. Honours Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Profit:</hi> Things which all men carneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſet the higheſt value upon. 1. It brings <hi>Honour.</hi> Obſerve what honourable <hi>Titles</hi> are given to good men in Scripture; they are called <hi>princes in all Lands, a crown of Glory, a royal Diadem, a choſen Generation, the Excellent of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. What <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid of <hi>Learning,</hi> is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to <hi>Religion: It makes young men ſober, old men happy, poor men rich, and rich men honourable.</hi> Vertue is a laſting Pillar, that cauſeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:48915:7"/> to be had in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The diſgrace which wicked men caſt upon them, is at worſt but like the noiſe of ſome loud tongue-Gun gone as ſoon as heard; but the Honour, which God and good men put upon them, is <hi>a pillar</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to all Eternity; ſuch a <hi>monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as neither time nor envy can waſte or wear out. 2. It brings <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> I know <hi>Satan</hi> would repreſent <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under uggly <hi>Vizards,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the moſt frightful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>forms,</hi> to make men loath both the one and the other: But <hi>Religion</hi> is far from ſuch a crabbed face, and auſtere countenance. Joy is one eſſential part of it. Rom. 14 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God conſiſteth not in meats and drinks, but in Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Her ways</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of Wiſdom) <hi>are ways of pleaſantneſs.</hi> Prov. 3. 17. The Pleaſure which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>

The <hi>Bleſſed Virgin's</hi> expreſſion is: <hi>My ſpirit rejoiceth in God my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Luke</hi> 1. 47. 2. 'Tis pure and unmixed. Ther's nothing adhering to it to make an abatement, or put a check to it. 3. 'Tis permanent and laſting. Carnal Pleaſure is of a ſhort continuance. Job. 20. 5. <hi>The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> compares it to the crackling of thorns under a pot, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 6. Carnal Joy, like a ſtanding pool quickly dries up, and leaves nothing but the mud of diſcontent: Whereas the Pleaſure, that <hi>Religion</hi> yields, is like a fountain of water, ever running. That is like a candle, which goeth out in a ſnuff, a ſtink; This, like the morning-light, ſhineth brighter and brighter unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:48915:8"/> day. 3. It brings Profit. And what is more earneſtly deſired, and highly valued by the Sons of men? The <hi>Souldier</hi> for this will ſcale the Walls, and leap upon the Pikes; The <hi>Merchant</hi> for this will plow the Ocean, and dance upon the ſurging Billows; the <hi>Husbandman</hi> for this will riſe up early, and go to bed late, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Godlineſs with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is great Gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 6. <hi>Wealth and Riches ſhall be in his Houſe,</hi> Pſal. 112. 3. <hi>Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand Riches and Honour,</hi> Prov. 3. 16.</p>
            <p>This juſt <hi>(Right Honourable</hi> and <hi>Worſhipful)</hi> but imperfect Account, which I have given you of <hi>Religion,</hi> diſcovers unto us two Things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Religion</hi> is no unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing. God hath graciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd Mans <hi>Duty</hi> and his <hi>Intereſt;</hi> in ſerving God he ſerves himſelf; in promoting Gods Glory he promotes
<pb facs="tcp:48915:9"/> his own Happineſs. Though God have the Right of abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and might exact Obedience on his bare Command; yet he's more pleaſed to ſhew himſelf a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> than a <hi>Lord;</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to treat with men by the more gentle and inviting methods of <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Rewards.</hi> Nay, indeed the end of his <hi>Commands</hi> is only to make us capable <hi>Subjects,</hi> of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Felicities</hi> he deſires to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. And this ſurely is enough, to excite Men to a faithful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe <hi>Talents</hi> they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, ſince 'tis indeed themſelves they are trading for. 'Tis true, the <hi>Stock</hi> is Gods; but all the <hi>Increaſe</hi> of it will by his bounty certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve on them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we ſhould in our ſeveral places zealouſly endeavour the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Religion. This is a Duty incumbent on all, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:48915:9"/> Perſons in Authority; and the Relation <hi>(Right Honourable</hi> and <hi>Worſhipful)</hi> I ſtand in to You, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me at this time to preſs it upon you. And your <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of Love and Zeal for <hi>Religion</hi> give me no ſmall encouragement, that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation will be kindly entertain'd. That it may make the deeper Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, let me add to the former Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, That in advancing <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> you will be highly ſerviceable both to your <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> lays the ſtrongeſt obligation upon men to give <hi>tribute to whom tribute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, and honour to whom honour is due; in a word, to render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars.</hi> Prov. 24. 21. <hi>My Son fear the Lord and the King.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Fear God, honour the King.</hi> Obſerve the order; firſt <hi>Fear God,</hi> and then <hi>Honour the King;</hi> implying, that men
<pb facs="tcp:48915:10"/> muſt be good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> before they can be good <hi>Subjects.</hi> Our late <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> doth acknowledg that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral influence, which <hi>Religion</hi> hath upon the obedience of <hi>Subjects;</hi> Take his own Words: <hi>'Tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if men, not fearing God, ſhould not honour their King. They will eaſily contemn ſuch Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of God, who reverence not that ſupream and adorable Majeſty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whom, all the glory of men and Angels is but obſcurity.</hi> And therefore he gives it in charge to his Son (our gracious <hi>Soveraign) to countenance and promote ſolid Piety.</hi> None are more obſervant of <hi>Laws,</hi> than they that are moſt a <hi>Law</hi> to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To your <hi>Country,</hi> yea the whole <hi>Kingdom.</hi> The <hi>Wiſeman</hi> tells us, <hi>That righteouſneſs exalteth a nation:</hi> It brings the <hi>Bleſſings of mirth and joy, peace and proſperity, wiſdom and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:10"/> 
               <hi>policy, riches and plenty, ſucceſs and victory.</hi> God promiſeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> to enrich them with all Bleſſings, and advance them above all Nations upon their faithful Obedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. And the <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> could acknowledg, <hi>That ſo long as Rome ſtood Religious, ſo long ſhe continued Victorious and Proſperous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did <hi>Religion</hi> univerſally prevail and influence the hearts and lives of men, then might we beat our <hi>Swords</hi> into <hi>plough-ſhares,</hi> and our <hi>Spears</hi> into <hi>pruning-books;</hi> then every man might ſit under his own <hi>Vine,</hi> eating the fruit thereof, and none ſhould make him afraid; then there would be no leading into <hi>Captivity,</hi> no complaining in our <hi>Streets;</hi> no vexatious <hi>Suits,</hi> no groanings of the oppreſſed, no private injuries, no publick Seditions. In a word, this would make <hi>England</hi> a Land of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, an heritage of glory, even the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Nations.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48915:11"/>
            <p> And in order to the advance of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo advantagious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, let me recommend two Things to your ſpecial care and obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſuppreſſion of ſuch <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> as ſubvert <hi>Religion;</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> How dangerous they are to <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and deſtructive of <hi>Vertue,</hi> you cannot be ignorant; and how male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert the <hi>Promoters</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of them are lately grown, is viſible to all. I am not for your ſheathing the Sword of Juſtice in their Bowels (ſuch ſeverity becometh <hi>Romaniſts</hi> beſt), yet let them know, you have one, and that you dare draw it in the defence of that <hi>Faith</hi> you own, which is truly <hi>Ancient, Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtrict Obſervation of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath.</hi> That this <hi>day</hi> is of Divine <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and grounded on the fourth <hi>Commandment,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb facs="tcp:48915:11"/> aſſerted in the <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> in theſe words: <q>Whatſoever is found in the Commandment, appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing moſt god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moſt juſt, and needful for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of Gods Glory, it ought to be retain'd and kept of all good Chriſtian People; and therefore by this Commandment we ought to have a Time, as one Day in the week, wherein one ought to reſt, yea from our lawful and needful works. For like-as it appeareth by this Commandment, That no man in the ſix days ought to be ſlothful or idle, but diligently to labour in that ſtate, wherein God hath ſet him: Even ſo God hath given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs charge to all men, That upon the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> which is now our <hi>Sunday,</hi> they ſhould ceaſe from all weekly and work-day labour; to the intent, That like-as God himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:48915:12"/> wrought ſix days, and reſted the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eventh, and bleſſed, and ſanctified it: Even ſo Gods obedient People ſhould uſe the <hi>Sunday</hi> holily <hi>(not in Sports and Plays)</hi> and reſt from their common and daily buſineſs, and alſo give themſelves wholly <hi>(not an hour or two)</hi> to heavenly Exerciſes of Gods true <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Service.</hi> So that God doth not only command the Obſervation of this <hi>Holy-day,</hi> but alſo by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth ſtir and provoke us to the diligent keeping of the ſame. If we will be the Children of our Heavenly Father, we muſt be careful to keep the Chriſtian <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,</hi> which is the <hi>Sunday;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that it is Gods expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but alſo to declare our ſelves to be loving Children in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Example of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord and Father.</q> In which words we may obſerve, 1. That by
<pb facs="tcp:48915:12"/> virtue of the fourth Commandment one day in ſeven is perpetually to be kept holy. 2. That the keeping of the Lords-day is grounded upon, and commanded in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. This <hi>Teſtimony</hi> I have urged to check thoſe, who confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Preach and Print too (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own <hi>Subſcriptions),</hi> That our <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath only the Churches <hi>Authority</hi> to ſupport it, and have no better Name, than <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick Preciſians,</hi> for the ſtrict <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But let me further add, and 'tis what I mainly intend, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and conſcientious Obſervation of this Day is the <hi>Support</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> A great Divine tells us; <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for the Sabbath is put in the cloſe of the Firſt, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond Table, to denote, That the Obſervation of both Tables depends much upon the ſanctification</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:13"/> 
               <hi>of this Day.</hi> And another obſerves, <hi>That Religion is juſt as the Sabbath is; it decays or grows as the Sabbath is eſteemed; it flouriſheth in a due veneration of the Sabbath, and it pines and conſumes, when the Sabbath is neglected.</hi> I never knew any <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Perſon</hi> eminent for Piety, that was not careful in the ſanctification of this Day.</p>
            <p>My next requeſt therefore <hi>(Right Honourable and Worſhipful)</hi> is, That you would unanimouſly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly endeavour to promote the ſtrict Obſervation of our <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath:</hi> Let not the notorious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faners</hi> of it eſcape unpuniſhed. I will not further oppreſs your Patience; only crave your <hi>Patronage</hi> and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and a thankful acknowledgment of the great Obligations you have laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48915:13"/>
            <p> That God would incline your hearts to contribute your utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards the advancement of true <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you in them, and Reward you for them; That he would Confer on you all the Bleſſings you want, and preſerve and ſanctifie thoſe you have, and Crown all with the unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Glories</hi> of another World, is now, and ſhall be the humble and fervent Prayer of</p>

            <p>IGnorant Perſons, who know little or nothing of <hi>Rome,</hi> but from the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> of her <hi>Paraſites,</hi> may be induced to fancy it to be no leſs, than <hi>a Heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi> and they, whoſe Ears are continually fill'd with the Venerable Expreſſions of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, Holy Fathers, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, Perpetual Succeſſions, S. Peters Chair &amp;c.</hi> ingeminated by <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> may (ſaith a late Writer) by the very ſound of ſuch Words, be ſome-what diſpoſ'd to entertain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſign of the following <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is to fortifie Theſe againſt ſuch allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by repreſenting both the one and the other in their true native Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: And to expoſe unto publick
<pb facs="tcp:48915:15"/> View ſuch diſmal Pieces of their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as whoſoever obſerves them well, ſhall have, I hope, no great temptation to look over-friendly towards <hi>Rome.</hi> And in Order to this end, I have uſed no arguments, but ſuch as all, that can read, may underſtand: My preſent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being only to inſtruct common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to lead them in a plain way.</p>
            <p>In diſcovering their <hi>Corruptions, Superſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I have uſed all ſincerity (urging nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to their prejudice, but what is found either in their publick Liturgies, or their beſt <hi>Authors)</hi> and as much moderation, as the matter in hand was capable of. Indeed I am forced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to call <hi>Things</hi> by their proper <hi>Names,</hi> as lying with another Mans Wife, <hi>Adultery;</hi> purloining another mans goods, <hi>Robbery;</hi> adoring Stocks and Stones, Idolatry: And if our <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> think theſe Expreſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil,
<pb facs="tcp:48915:15"/> and inſtead of confeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of what is moſt juſtly charged upon them, complain that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them; I muſt anſwer ſome-what like <hi>Elijah</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>That they are the only men who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached themſelves.</hi> For I only ſay that which they do, and caſt nothing upon their <hi>Face</hi> but what I find in their <hi>Boſome;</hi> and not the hundredth Part of it. Some Hours and Days, and Weeks, I have ſpent in Reading their <hi>Miſſals, Breviaries, Rituals,</hi> and <hi>Authors</hi> of chiefeſt note amongſt them; and find their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> ſo contrariant to Scripture, ſo abſurd and Ridiculous, that I muſt publickly profeſs an utter deteſtation of it: Yet I think it not a much leſs ſin to make <hi>Papiſts</hi> worſe than they are, than to make Widows more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, or add Affliction to the afflicted.</p>
            <p>I have intituled this Book, <hi>An Exact Parallel between Rome-Pagan</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:16"/> 
               <hi>and Rome-Chriſtian,</hi> &amp;c. And how truly, I leave it to any one, upon an impartial View, to judg. Many things are purpoſely omitted for brevity ſake, and ſeveral <hi>Reflexions</hi> upon what I have mention'd (which perhaps might have made this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſome) to prevent the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Railer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Poſitions</hi> laid down, and not with more Zeal than Policy defended by the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> for I do not ſee, how they could ſecure their deluded <hi>Proſelytes</hi> without them.</p>
            <p>1. That 'tis not convenient, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People ſhould know much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and therefore they take from them the Key of Knowledg, I mean the uſe of their Bibles. <note place="margin">Bellarmin <hi>ſaith, That Faith is to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> De Juſtificat. Lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> Thieves will blow out the Candles for fear of being diſcover'd. I know the common Plea, is, <hi>That Scripture is dark, and that the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:16"/> 
               <hi>ignorant might be ſeduced by it:</hi> But they that ſpeak thus, do not only accuſe Scripture of obſcurity, but of untruth alſo; for Scripture bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it ſelf, That 'tis clear, and made to give Light to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8, <hi>The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord is pure, inlightning the eyes.</hi> Pſal. 119. 105, <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my Feet, and a Light unto my Path.</hi> The <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> are of all Scripture the moſt obſcure; yet S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, That they are like <hi>a Light ſhining in a dark place.</hi> Thus they accuſe Scripture of untruth, when they accuſe it of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and with that caſt a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon God, as if he had digg'd a pit, to make men fall into it in the dark, and deliver'd the Doctrine of Salvation in obſcure Terms, to lead men into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; like one, that makes his <hi>Will</hi> in ambiguous words, purpoſely to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Strife among his Heirs. Should
<pb facs="tcp:48915:17"/> the Father of Lights ſtudy obſcurity? He that gave his Son to ſave his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Should he be envious of the Salvation of his Children? If the Scripture muſt be prohibited to the People, leſt they fall into Hereſie; by the ſame, nay, by a ſtronger reaſon it ought to be prohibited to <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſince from them, not from the People, all Hereſies have proceeded. Read the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of ancient <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> made by S. <hi>Auſtin, Epiphanius—</hi>and you will find, that almoſt all the <hi>Hereſiarchs</hi> were <hi>Clergymen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'Tis no wonder, that our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> find Scripture dark, ſince they cannot find in it, what they would. For he muſt needs have piercing Eyes and a reaching Wit, that can find in Scripture a Command for <hi>Sacrificing the Body of Chriſt in the Maſs,</hi> or <hi>the Invocation of Saints,</hi> or <hi>the Veneration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>

            <p>The advice, which certain <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Bononia</hi> gave unto <hi>Pope Paul</hi> 3. was, <hi>That no Mortal ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read more of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that little, which was wont to be read in the Maſs.</hi> And they give two weighty Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe ſo long as men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that little, your Affairs ſucceeded according to deſire; but quite contrary, ſince ſo much of the Scriptures was read.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe if any one read that Book,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scriptures, and obſerve the Cuſtoms and Practices of our Church, he will ſee, that there is no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and that the Doctrine,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:18"/> 
               <hi>which we Preach, is altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from, and ſometimes contrary to that contained in the Bible.</hi> The Doctrine of an <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> is of ſingular <hi>Uſe,</hi> and admirable <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> to the Church, that delivers it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:48915:19"/> non ſcript. Lib. 4. cap. 12. <hi>The Church</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lindanus) was not tyed to Scripture by the will of Chriſt.</hi> Panopl. Lib. 5. cap. 5. <hi>Chriſt would not have his Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Scriptures of paper, and would not commit his Myſteries to Parchment,</hi> Coſterus Enchirid. cap. 1. p. 43. And <hi>Salmeron</hi> gives us a Reaſon, why God would not have all the Myſteries of Religion to be written, viz. That the Commandment of Chriſt ſhould be kept; <hi>Give not holy things unto dogs, Tom.</hi> 13. <hi>diſput.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 216. Which Reaſon is alſo given by <hi>Coſterus, Enchirid.</hi> cap. 1. p. 48.</p>
            <p>Nay 'tis moſt evident, That they have exalted <hi>Traditions</hi> above Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Coſterus</hi> calleth the <hi>Tradition,</hi> Printed in the Heart of the Church, another kind of Scripture. <hi>The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>far ſurmounteth the Holy Scriptures, which the Apoſtles have left in parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:19"/> Enchirid. cap. 1. p. 44. <hi>Stap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi> affirms, <hi>That the Church's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination is of greater Authority than the Scripture, de Auth. Script. Controverſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. And in another place he ſaith; <hi>That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it ſelf is not ſo much the Rule of Faith, as the Faith of the Church (that is, the Tradition of</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) <hi>is the Rule of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they ſpeak more reverently of <hi>Traditions,</hi> than of the Scripture; Did they ever call them <hi>a noſe of Wax, a ſtumbling Block, a dumb Rule, an obſcure and ambiguous Doctrine—as they have too often the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Again, ſins againſt theſe are more ſeverely puniſhed, than thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the expreſs Law of God. <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> can give <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> for <hi>Murther, Perjury, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—</hi>But the other are often reſerved to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> except in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48915:20"/> of death. If <hi>a Prieſt</hi> marry to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void fornication, according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles command, he fals into <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> and becomes unable to ſing <hi>Maſs;</hi> but not for keeping <hi>a Whore,</hi> or for being <hi>a Sodomite, Decret.

            <p>Laſtly, they are a thouſand times more careful to inſtruct the People in theſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> than in the Doctrine of Salvation, contain'd in the Holy Scripture. And no wonder, that Theſe ſhould be exalted by <hi>Romaniſts</hi> above Scripture, ſince they are infinitely more ſerviceable to them; For when Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture faileth them (as often it doth according to the confeſſions of their own Doctors) they have recourſe to Theſe. How frequently are Traditions urged for the <hi>Popes Supremacy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Purgatory, Suffrages for the dead—</hi>For their Ridiculous and ſuperſtitious <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> Some of
<pb facs="tcp:48915:20"/> which are mentioned in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, here the Reader may ſee the true <hi>Original</hi> of thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> (ſo much admired, and confidently urged by <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> the beſotting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the tremendous judgment of God, puniſhing Errour with an <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>THE Introduction.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CESAR</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Wife,</hi> That ſhe ought to be without ſuſpicion of fault, as well as without fault. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> having a drop of the water ſprinkled upon his Garment, which was caſt by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in their <hi>Heatheniſh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> cut out that piece of cloth upon which that drop fell, from the reſt of the Garment. The ancient Chriſtians would not ſet up <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Bayes</hi> at their doors, though for this they were perſecuted as Enemies to the Emperor, becauſe the <hi>Temples</hi> and the <hi>doors</hi> of <hi>Idolaters</hi> were wont to be thus garniſhed, <hi>Tertullian de Idolatria,</hi> cap. 15. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Worthies</hi> would not endure that any Chriſtian ſhould look toward <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> praying, becauſe they would avoid all ſhew of <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought it in his time unlawful to faſt on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Manichees</hi> did ſo: And he retracted even <hi>Ironies,</hi> becauſe they had the appearance of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48915:26"/> lying. God appointed his own <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ſo as a Wall of Partition might be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> in which reſpect his people are forbid to eat Swines fleſh (the ordinary food of <hi>Pagans),</hi> to make their heads bald, to ſhave their beards, to cut their fleſh. And <hi>Aquinas</hi> thinks, that becauſe the Heathen ſet their <hi>Temples Eastward,</hi> therefore <hi>God</hi>'s was ſet <hi>Weſtward,</hi> 12 <hi>Queſt.</hi> 102. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commands his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and in them all Chriſtians, to abſtain from all appearance of evil; not only apparent ſins, but ſins in appearance are to be avoided by Chriſtians. If we look back to the old Law, how often do we find God giving it in charge to his people, that they ſhould not imitate the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> eſpecially in their <hi>ſuperſtitious Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>religious Ceremonies?</hi> Lev. 18. 3, <hi>After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, ſhall ye not do; neither ſhall ye walk in their Ordinances.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth)</hi> explain it thus: <hi>We may not walk in the ſtatutes of the Heathen, nor be like unto them either in apparel, or in hair. A man muſt not let the locks of his head grow like the locks of their heads; nor ſhave off the ſides, and leave the hair in the midſt, as they do,</hi> &amp;c. and the reaſon is given, <hi>Becauſe, the Lord had ſeparated them from other people.</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48915:26"/> This Command is repeated, and a Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 22, 23. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were often admoniſhed by the Prophets, Jer. 10. 2, <hi>Learn not the way of the heathen;</hi> do not <hi>ſymbolize</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>How little theſe repeated <hi>Injunctions</hi> are obſerved by thoſe of the <hi>Roman Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is too evident to conſiderative minds. That moſt of the <hi>principal Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Sacred Ceremonies</hi> of that Church are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Pagans,</hi> or at leaſt have a perfect agreement with them, is ſo manifeſt a Truth, that certainly none can doubt of it who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any knowledg of them. <q>When I call to mind the Inſtitutions of the Holy Myſteries of <hi>Ethnicks</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus)</hi> I am even forced to believe, That moſt things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the celebration of our <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> are taken thence. As for example, From the <hi>Gentile Religion</hi> are the <hi>ſhaven heads of prieſts, turnings round at the Altar, ſacrifical pomp,</hi> and many ſuch like Ceremonies which our Prieſts ſolemnly uſe in our <hi>Myſteries.</hi> How many things (good God!) in our <hi>Religion</hi> are like to the <hi>Pagan Religion?</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Rites</hi> common?</q>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48915:29"/> his ſanctity of life, purity of faith, and working of Miracles; and to tranſmit the <hi>depoſitions</hi> under hand and ſeal unto the <hi>Court.</hi> Theſe being received, the Pope commits the examination of them to ſome <hi>Auditors</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Palace,</hi> whether they be full and ſatisfactory. When all things are ſufficiently proved, the Pope decrees the <hi>Canonization,</hi> and appoints a day for it. In the mean time great preparations are made: as, 1. A Stage is built in the Church of that largeneſs, that upon it there may be a <hi>Chappel</hi> with an <hi>Altar,</hi> a <hi>Pontifical Throne,</hi> &amp;c. 2. A great <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Enſign</hi> is made with the Image of the Saint, which muſt be carried before the <hi>Religious,</hi> or thoſe who procure the Canonization. 3. Wax Candles are prepared, which muſt be diſtributed: For the <hi>Pope</hi> two Candles of white Wax of Twelve pounds a piece; for <hi>Cardinals,</hi> of Four pounds. Alſo for the <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> twelve <hi>Wax Tapers,</hi> every one of Six pounds; for the <hi>Altar</hi> Seven Wax Candles, and two for the <note n="*" place="margin">This Credentia is a Table to ſet Veſſels upon.</note> 
                     <hi>Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> of Two pounds. Alſo for the <hi>Offertory</hi> two great Wax Candles of Twelve pounds, which the firſt <hi>Cardinal</hi> offereth; alſo three Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of Six pounds, which the <hi>Orators</hi> or

                     <hi>Deputies</hi> with three <hi>Cardinals</hi> muſt offer. And all the foreſaid Candles muſt be white; beſides Eighty <hi>Wax Tapers</hi> for the Church. 4. There muſt be prepared Candles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wax for <hi>Biſhops, Orators,</hi> and <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> of Two pounds; for <hi>Officials</hi> and <hi>Singers,</hi> of One pound; and for the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and others as they pleaſe. On the day of Canonization, the <hi>Pope,</hi> with his <hi>Cardinals, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Officials,</hi> all in their proper Robes and Ornaments, goes in <hi>proceſſion</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi> In the <hi>Camera Paramenti</hi> the <hi>Candles</hi> are diſtributed, and all carry them lighted. When the Pope comes to the Porch of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he is received by the Clergy of the City after the manner of <hi>Supplicants.</hi> His <hi>Holineſs</hi> enters the Church, and aſcends the <hi>ſtage</hi> with the Cardinals and other Officials; but the Clergy ſtand about it. And having prayed before an <hi>Altar,</hi> he makes a Speech, in which he gives them an account of what hath been done, and relates the Life and Miracles of this Saint. This being ended, his <hi>Holineſs</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts all to pour forth their prayers unto God, That he would not ſuffer his Church to err in this matter. Then the <hi>Litany</hi> is ſung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then, after the <hi>Proctor</hi> hath earneſtly requeſted the Pope in the name of the Prince or people, That he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

THE <hi>Heathen</hi> invocated their <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Demons</hi> as <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>Interceſſors</hi> to the Supreme God. <hi>Thales, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and other <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophers, held only one Supream Eternal Being, which they called GOD. Now this chief God was, as they ſuppoſed, at ſuch an infinite diſtance from poor Mortals and Sinners, as that there could be no approach to him, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of good things from him, but by ſome <hi>Mediators</hi> or <hi>Midling-gods;</hi> theſe <hi>Middle-gods</hi> or <hi>Mediators</hi> were no other than their great <hi>Heroes,</hi> or perſons who had been greatly famous in their Age for ſome noble <hi>Exploits</hi> (ſaith <hi>Minutius Felix)</hi> or vertuous acts; and after their death were by common conſent deified or made gods; and called by ſome from their Office <hi>Medioxumi;</hi> from the place of their main reſidence (which was ſuppoſed to be in the Stars), <hi>Deaſtri;</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48915:31"/> from their relation to the Superior God, the <hi>leſſer gods,</hi> the <hi>made gods;</hi> and from their knowledg of humane affairs, <hi>Demons.</hi> Of theſe <hi>Demons Plato</hi> diſcourſeth very largely in ſeveral places; where, 1. Touching their natures, he calls them <hi>made gods, viſible gods,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Touching their <hi>Office,</hi> he ſays, They were placed in the middle, 'twixt the great God and Man, to be <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>Porters,</hi> for conveying the Sacrifices and Prayers of men to the great God; as alſo, for tranſmitting <hi>gifts</hi> and all good things from <hi>God</hi> to men. 3. That by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe <hi>Demons</hi> there is a communion and friendſhip maintained betwixt God and men, which otherwiſe could not be. <q>God is not approached by men (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Sympoſium);</hi> but all the commerce and intercourſe between him and men, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the mediations of <hi>Demons.</hi> And then he comes to particulars: <hi>Demons</hi> are <hi>Reporters</hi> and <hi>Carriers</hi> from men to the gods, and again from the gods to men; of the Supplications and Prayers of the one, and of the Injunctions and Rewards of Devotion from the other. <hi>Demons</hi> are <hi>middle powers</hi> (ſaith <hi>Apuleius),</hi> by whom both our deſires and merits paſs unto the gods; they are <hi>Carriers</hi> between men on earth, and the gods in heaven; hence of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48915:32"/> prayers, thence of gifts; they bring to and fro, hence petitions, thence ſupplies: or they are certain <hi>Interpeters</hi> on both ſides, and <hi>Conveyers</hi> of recommendations: for (ſaith he) the Majeſty of the Soveraign gods will not permit them to manage theſe things of themſelves;</q> 
                  <hi>De Deo Socratis.</hi> And S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> gives the ſame account of them, <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. From theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies 'tis clear, That the Heathen invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe <hi>Demons</hi> as their <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors</hi> with the Supream God.</p>
               <p>Thus do <hi>Papiſts</hi> invocate the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>Interceſſors</hi> to God for them. They attribute the ſame <hi>Offices</hi> to their <hi>Saints,</hi> that the <hi>Heathen</hi> did to their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and urge the very ſame reaſons. <hi>When they are aſham'd</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Pagans) of having neglected God, they uſe a pitiful excuſe, ſaying, That they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Supream God by theſe gods; as by the Lords and Earls about the Court, ſubjects have acceſs unto the King.</hi> The weakneſs and vanity of which argument, he fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers in the ſame place, in <hi>Rom. cap.</hi> 1. And the ſame reaſon is urged by <hi>Celſus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> viz. <hi>That none dare to approach the perſon of an earthly Prince with a petition, but by the interceſſion of ſome Courtier or other about him; therefore it ſhould be ſo on our part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48915:32"/> 
                  <hi>God, unto whoſe glorious Majesty we must uſe the Mediation of ſome which are in his favour.</hi> The abſurdity of this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there alſo fully demonſtrate. <hi>Contra Celſum lib.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And do not our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> urge the very ſame Argument? <hi>It is good and profitable</hi> (ſaith the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſ. 25.) <hi>to call upon the Saints, and to have recourſe to their prayers, aid and aſſiſtance, whereby to obtain from God many benefits by the merits of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Redeemer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> This is further clear from many forms of prayer uſed to particular Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We humbly beſeech thy Majeſty, that as the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Andrew</hi> was a Preacher and Rector of thy Church; ſo he may be with thee a perpetual Interceſſor for us.</q> 
                  <hi>In Feſto</hi> S. <hi>Andreae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Almighty and everlaſting God, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt us glad with the Feſtivity of Bleſſed <hi>Oſmund</hi> thy Confeſſor and Biſhop; we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thy Clemency, that we who venerate his ſolemnities with devout Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may obtain the remedies of eternal life by his ſuffrages: <hi>In Feſto</hi> S. <hi>Oſmundi.</hi>
                  </q> The like you have in <hi>Festis</hi> S. <hi>Sulpicii,</hi> S. <hi>Priſcae,</hi> S. <hi>Vincentii,</hi> S. <hi>Blaſii,</hi> S. <hi>Bonifacii, &amp;c. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale ſecundum uſum Sarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Heathen</hi> in their <hi>Invocations</hi> urged
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48915:33"/> the merits of theſe <hi>Demons,</hi> or <hi>middle-gods.</hi> 
                  <q>Theſe <hi>Demons</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> according to the opinion of the Gentiles) are Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Meſſengers between God and men, that hence they might carry our Petitions, and thence bring us Supplies. And obſerve the ground or reaſon; Becauſe they excel us mortals in Merits.</q> 
                  <hi>De Civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Thus do Papiſts in their prayers to Saints, urge their merits, that is, deſire to be heard for their merits. The truth of this is moſt evident from theſe following prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord, let the holy prayer of B. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> make our Sacrifice pleaſing to thee; that being ſolemnly exhibited to his honor, it may be made acceptable by his Merits, through our Lord.</q> 
                  <hi>In Feſto</hi> S. <hi>Andreae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O God, who haſt adorned bleſſed <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> thy Biſhop with innumerable Miracles; grant unto us, we beſeech thee, that by his Merits and Prayers we may be delivered from the flames of Hell, through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>In Festo</hi> S. <hi>Nicolai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord, we beſeech thee graciouſly to hear the prayers of thy people, that we may be aſſiſted by the Merits of Bleſſed <hi>Marcellus</hi> thy Martyr and Biſhop, in whoſe paſſion we rejoice, through our Lord.</q> 
                  <hi>In Festo</hi> S. <hi>Marcelli.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48915:33"/>
               <p>
                  <q>Look, O Lord, we beſeech thee, upon what we have now offered unto thee; and by the merits of Bleſſed Biſhop <hi>Julian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from all our ſins, through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>In Feſto</hi> S. <hi>Juliani.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like you have in <hi>Feſtis</hi> S. <hi>Valentini,</hi> S. <hi>Julianae,</hi> S. <hi>Potentianae,</hi> S. <hi>Aldelmi,</hi> S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellini,</hi> S. <hi>Bonifacii,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Miſſale ſec. uſ. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Heathen invocated their Demons or Gods, for help and all good things, as the immediate Authors and Donors of them. <q>Certain gods with you (ſaith <hi>Arnobius)</hi> have certain Guardianſhips, Licences, and Powers; neither do ye ask from any of them, that which is not in their power and donation. Ye believe that <hi>Liber</hi> can give Wine, but not Phyſick; <hi>Ceres</hi> fruit; <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> health; <hi>Neptune</hi> another thing; and another thing <hi>Juno; Fortune, Mercury, Vulcan,</hi> they are givers of certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things: <hi>Adverſus Gentes, lib.</hi> 2.</q> And that of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> imports no leſs; <q>The knowledg of the gods is neceſſary, that we may direct our Petitions to them aright, and not ask Water from the god of Wine; or Wine from the goddeſſes of Water: <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pray unto their Saints for all good things both of this and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48915:34"/> the other life, as the immediate Authors and Donors of them. They call the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> not only an <hi>Advocate,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Mediator, Helper Redeemer; the Throne of Grace, the Gate of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But more particularly: They pray unto the Saints,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Remiſſion of ſin. Have mercy upon me, O Lady, who art called the Mother of Mercy; and according to the bowels of thy compaſſions cleanſe me from all mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. O Lady, in thy Name make me ſafe, and deliver me from mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſes, that the craftineſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy may not hurt me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. <hi>In Pſalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio B. Mariae.</hi> We call upon thee with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ſighs, and pray unto thee with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate piety. Blot out the internal ſins of our thoughts, and the external ſins of our works. And a little after: We ſigh with weeping for our ſins; yet we truſt in thee, Mother of Piety: Give pardon freely to them that are penitent. <hi>Horae B. Virg. ſec. uſ. Sarum,</hi> p. 147.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Heathen</hi> had particular gods for every Countrey, City, and Place; yea, for every thing: <hi>Minutius Felix Octav. p.</hi> 12. <hi>Arnob. Adv. Gent. lib.</hi> 8. They had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Demons</hi> for every Countrey, to whom the protection of that Countrey was committed, and Sacrifices offered by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> thereof. To clear up this, we need go no further than <hi>Holy Writ.</hi> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had <hi>Baal, Judg.</hi> 8. 33. The <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians Aſhtaroth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 5. The <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites Moloch,</hi> v. 7. The <hi>Moabites Chemoſh, ibid.</hi> The <hi>Philiſtins Dagon, Judg.</hi> 16. 23. And every Nation that came out of <hi>Aſhur,</hi> had a ſeveral god. The men of <hi>Babel, Succoth-Benoth,</hi> 2 King. 17. 30. The men of <hi>Cuth, Nergal,</hi> ibid. The men of <hi>Hamath, Aſhima,</hi> ibid. The <hi>Avites, Nibhar,</hi> and <hi>Tartake,</hi> v. 31. And the <hi>Sepharvites, Adramelech,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> ibid. And if we look into their own Hiſtorians, this will appear to be a great truth. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had <hi>Iſis;</hi> the <hi>Moors Juba;</hi> the <hi>Macedonians Carylus;</hi> the <hi>Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ramus;</hi> the <hi>Latins Faunus;</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines Sancus;</hi> the <hi>Romans Quirinus;</hi> the

               <p>Thus do Papiſts appoint <hi>Tutelar Saints</hi> over particular Countries: S. <hi>George</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> S. <hi>Patrick</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> S. <hi>Andrew</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> S. <hi>Martin</hi> for <hi>Germany,</hi> S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> for the Territories of <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> S. <hi>Michael</hi> and S. <hi>Denys</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> S. <hi>Gallus</hi> for <hi>Helvetia,</hi> S. <hi>Lewis</hi> for <hi>Hungary,</hi> S. <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> for <hi>Poland,</hi> S. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> for <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> &amp;c. This is ſo well known, that I need not cite Authors for it.</p>
               <p>2 The Pagans had <hi>Tutelar gods</hi> for every City: <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us, That all Cities are under the tutelage and protection of ſome god, <hi>Saturn. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9: and a little after he ſaith, <q>That it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> when they beſieged a City, to uſe a certain charm (two or three he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48915:39"/> in the ſame Chap.) to call away their Tutelar god; becauſe otherwiſe they thought it impoſſible to take the City.</q> And to prevent this, the <hi>Romans</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to name or enquire after their Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar god, <hi>Plut. in Quaeſt. Rom. Quaeſt.</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith of Revolting <hi>Judah,</hi> chap. 2. 28, <hi>According to the number of thy Cities are thy gods;</hi> after the manner of the Heathen; <hi>Paphos</hi> had <hi>Venus, Athens Minerva, Epheſus Diana, Delph Apollo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have Tutelar Saints for every City; S. <hi>Mark</hi> for <hi>Venice,</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> for <hi>Millain,</hi> S. <hi>Genoveſa</hi> for <hi>Paris,</hi> S. <hi>Stephen</hi> for <hi>Vienna,</hi> S. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lderick</hi> for <hi>Auguſta,</hi> S. <hi>Anatolius</hi> for <hi>Salina,</hi> the three King, for <hi>Cologne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. The Pagans had gods for every place, the Mountains, Valleys, Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin de Civit. Dei,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 21. <hi>Arnob. Adverſ. Gent.</hi> lib. 4, and others write. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatinus</hi> was a god for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48915:39"/>
               <p> Thus Papiſts have Saints for every place; S. <hi>Barbara</hi> for the Hills, and S. <hi>Agatha</hi> for the Valleys, S. <hi>Silveſter</hi> for the Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THE Heathen fancied, that their gods had a peculiar power, and thereupon aſſign'd them their ſeveral Offices, ſaith <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius adv. Gent. lib.</hi> 3. And S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of them <hi>(lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Civit. Dei,</hi> cap. 22) ſaith, <q>
                     <hi>Varro</hi> affirms, That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the gods is neceſſary, that we may direct our Petitions to them aright, and not ask Water from the god of Wine, or Wine from the goddeſſes of Water. Certain gods with you (ſaith <hi>Arnobius)</hi> have certain Guardianſhips, Licenſes, and Powers; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye ask from any of them that which is not in their power and donation. Ye believe that <hi>Liber</hi> can give Wine, but not Phyſick; <hi>Ceres</hi> fruits, <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> health, <hi>Neptune</hi> another thing; and another thing <hi>Juno, Fortune, Mercury, Vulcan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adver.

And the very ſame thing is affirmed by our <hi>Romanists</hi> of their Saints, That ſaying of <hi>Virgil, Non omnia poſſumus omnes,</hi> is true of the Saints, ſaith <hi>Biel:</hi> 
                  <q>For all gifts are

                  </q> 32, <hi>in Can. Miſſae.</hi> That herein there is a perfect agreement between the <hi>Pagans</hi> and our <hi>Romanists,</hi> will more fully appear in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>1 The <hi>Heathen</hi> prayed to <hi>Apollo</hi> or <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculapius,</hi> or both of them, when viſited with ſickneſs, S. <hi>Aust. de Civit. Dei,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 17. lib. 4. cap. 21.</p>
               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romanists</hi> in the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or under the ſame circumſtances, pray to their Saints; yea, they have a particular Saint for every Diſeaſe, which they pray unto.</p>
               <p>1 When viſited with the Plague, they pray unto S. <hi>Roch</hi> and S. <hi>Sebastian.</hi>

So much is affirmed by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> out of <hi>Varro, De Civit.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48915:47"/> And then he mentions certain gods for every thing relating to man, and ſhews what their office is, and for what every one ought to be ſupplicated.

To prevent this, he left them, and went to a Prince in a remote Countrey, where he behaved himſelf ſo well, that the Prince gave him in marriage a noble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. This being known to his Parents, they came to viſit him; and though they found their Son from home, yet his Wife when ſhe underſtood who they were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them honourably, and lodged them in her own Chamber. But early the next morning, when ſhe was at her devotions, her Husband return'd; and going into the Chamber, kill'd both his Parents, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he had found a ſtranger in bed with his Wife.

                  <p>S. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> for Whores. Very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is that which their <hi>Alf. Villegas</hi> writes concerning this Saint; and though it be ſomething long, yet I cannot well paſs it over, ſince it may be very ſerviceable to the Modiſh Ladies of our times, not perfectly inſtructed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Friend of God, hath left written in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That when God in the beginning created the World, he made two great Lights, but one bigger than the other; and placed them in Heaven: The greater was to give light in the day, and the leſſer to ſhine in the night. Theſe two Lights, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and the Moon, adorn the Heavens very much. Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, when he founded his Church, put therein two Lights, that is, the Sun and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48915:49"/> Moon: The Sun was to give light to them that walked by day, and the Moon to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate thoſe that travel by night.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now let us ſee who is this Sun in the Church, and who is this Moon. We may well ſay, This Sun, clear, reſplendent, and without any ſpot or ſtain, is the glorious Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> for her very great clearneſs and beauty, for that ſhe bore in her Womb <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our God, who is the true <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Jeſtice;</hi> and becauſe ſhe is cloathed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the Evangeliſt S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of her in his <hi>Revelations; I ſaw a Woman clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sun,</hi> whom all the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay is the <hi>Mother of God.</hi> But how cometh it to paſs that ſhe is ſaid to be the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the Day, and to give light thereunto? They are like the clear and bright Day, that be in the grace of God, becauſe theſe do works worthy to be ſeen. Of theſe then is this <hi>Sun Preſident,</hi> and to them giveth light, in ſhewing them the way of Vertue, by which men go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We have found who is the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the greater <hi>Light</hi> of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the religious <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Let us now ſee who is the leſſer <hi>Light</hi> that illuminateth the Church by night: This is the Second <hi>Mary,</hi> the B. S. <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and this Name fitteth her very well: For as the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48915:50"/> 
                        <hi>Moon</hi> on one ſide is dark; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, where the <hi>Sun</hi> beholdeth her, clear and reſplendent; even ſo part of the life of this bleſſed Saint was ugly, dark, and ſpotted with many ſins; but on the other part whereunto the true <hi>Sun</hi> of Juſtice Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt directed his beams, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to him, it was clear and beautiful.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But why, will you ſay, is ſhe <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Night,</hi> and doth illuminate it, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth light to them that walk by night? With great reaſon we may call them <hi>Night,</hi> which be in mortal ſin, that do works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to appear before the eyes of men. Of theſe perſons S. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,</hi> ſhewing unto them the way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance wherein they ought to walk.</q> 
                     <hi>In ejus vita.</hi>

                  <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> for <hi>Painters. Villegas</hi> tells us, That he made two excellent Pictures of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> which he conſtantly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with him, and wrought Miracles by them. <hi>In vita S.</hi> Lucae. Hereupon theſe <hi>Artiſts</hi> make choice of this <hi>Saint</hi> for their <hi>Patron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have many more <hi>Saints</hi> for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Profeſſions;</hi> as S. <hi>Criſpin</hi> for <hi>Shoomakers,</hi> S. <hi>Eulogius</hi> for <hi>Smiths,</hi> S. <hi>Gotarus</hi> for <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> S. <hi>Severus</hi> for <hi>Fullers,</hi> &amp;c. So that what is affirmed by <hi>Arnobius</hi> concerning the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48915:50"/> 
                     <hi>gods,</hi> viz. <hi>That they were Preſidents of Arts,</hi> Adv. Gent. lib. 3. may as truly be ſaid of our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> concerning their Saints, <hi>They are Patrons of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Papiſts have a particular <hi>Saint</hi> (as the Pagans had a <hi>Demon)</hi> for perſons of all <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> and in all <hi>Conditions,</hi> even from their conception to their diſſolution; yea, at death they have a particular Saint, into whoſe hands they commend their ſpirits, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> This is clear from a certain form of prayer in many old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books, where they are taught to pray thus at the hour of death:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Bleſſed</hi> Mary, <hi>Holy Moder of God, grant that I may end my life in the true faith of holy Kirk; and I commend my ſoul to thee,</hi> &amp;c. See the like Prayer in the <hi>Roſary,</hi> p. 59.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O moſt prudent Virgin, who entring the Heavenly Palace, didſt fill the holy Angels with joy, and men with hope; vouchſafe to intercede for us in the hour of our death, that free from the illuſions and temptations of the Devil, we may joyfully and ſecurely paſs out of this temporal ſtate, to enjoy the happineſs of eternal life.</hi>

               <p>1. THE <hi>Heathen</hi> made <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of their gods, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 26, 27. The <hi>Trojans</hi> had the Statue of <hi>Pallas</hi> (their Goddeſs) called the <hi>Palladium,</hi> in which they repoſed a great deal of truſt; for the Oracles had proclaimed, That they ſhould never be overcome by their Enemies whilſt they could keep it amongſt them. The <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> dedicated to <hi>Apollo</hi> that famous <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus</hi> of Braſs, 800 foot in height, and of a proportionable bigneſs, which was broken down by the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the year of our Lord 684. We read alſo of the Statue of <hi>Diana,</hi> which <hi>Oreſtes</hi> took out of her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to appeaſe the <hi>Furies</hi> for the murther of his Mother <hi>Clytemneſtra.</hi> And of the Statue of <hi>Jupiter Olympias,</hi> made by <hi>Phidias,</hi> it was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48915:51"/> an hundred and fifty Cubits high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holinſhead</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Britain,</hi> p. 22. tells us, <q>That the Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Pagan gods were of a monſtrous greatneſs; and that each Nation contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which ſhould honour the greater <hi>Blocks;</hi> and yet all pretended to have the juſt height of the god or goddeſs whom they did repreſent.</q>

                     <hi>Apollo Capitolinus,</hi> that ſtood at <hi>Rome,</hi> was thirty cubits high at the leaſt; <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Jupiter</hi> of forty foot; <hi>Tuſcanus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> that ſtood in the Temple of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> of fifty foot; another made under <hi>Nero,</hi> of an hundred and ten foot: But one in <hi>France</hi> ſurpaſſed all, which <hi>Zenoduris</hi> made unto <hi>Mercury</hi> at <hi>Avernum</hi> in ten years ſpace, of 400 foot.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirms, That Images are taken from <hi>Pagans,</hi> who were wont to honour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner ſuch as they accounted <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, Hist.

               <p>The <hi>Pagans</hi> did not only make Images and Statues of their gods, but they adorned them with variety of Ornaments, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>They deck it with ſilver and with gold.</hi> V. 9. <hi>Silver ſpread into plates is brought from</hi>

So <hi>Arnob. Adverſ. Gent.</hi> lib. 6. <hi>Tertul. de Idolat.</hi> cap. 3. And <hi>Voſſius</hi> deſcribes their various Habits, <hi>De Phyſiol. Chriſtian. &amp; Theol. Gent.</hi> lib. 9. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reports of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Tyrant, King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> a notorious contemner and ſpoiler of Images, That en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a <hi>Temple,</hi> he took from <hi>Juiter Olympus</hi> a garment made of beaten gold, of a great weight, wherewith <hi>Hiero</hi> had adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him out of the ſpoils of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and for this he put upon him a <hi>Woollen Mantle,</hi> affirming, that the other was too heavy for <hi>Summer,</hi> and too cold for <hi>Winter;</hi> but this <hi>Mantle</hi> is fit for both ſeaſons. And coming into another <hi>Temple</hi> where the Statues of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> &amp; <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> were together, and that of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> had a great Beard of maſſy-gold; he told him, It was not fit that he ſhould have a Beard, and that <hi>Apollo</hi> his Father ſhould have none; therefore he cauſed it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and melted for his own uſe. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Arnobius</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> relate the ſame Stories in the fore-cited places.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48915:52"/>
               <p> Thus our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> make Images and Statues of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and beautifie them with many rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. <hi>Durantus</hi> informs us, That the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romans</hi> uſed to crown their Statues, which he proves out of <hi>Ammianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> and <hi>Velleius Paterculus.</hi> Hence (ſaith he) to this day the Images of Saints are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven and painted <hi>cum ſolari corona.</hi> And then he gives us the reaſon of it. <q>
                     <hi>Turſellin</hi> mentions ſeveral garments richly embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and adorned with <hi>Orient Jewels</hi> for the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> preſented by Princes and Noble-men. <hi>Juſtus Juſteius</hi> Earl of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> gave to the B. Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cloth of Gold, faced with coſtly skins, being the Prize of the <hi>Tilters,</hi> gotten at the Games of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleve</hi> preſented her with a Chain of Gold, notable for weight and workmanſhip; gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bracelets beſet with Carbuncles and Diamonds, and a gold Ring of great worth by reaſon of an excellent Jewel.</q> 
                  <hi>Hiſtor. Lauret.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 13. <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> tells us, how the people were inveigled by their Prieſts to adorn the Images of Saints; and reproves their exceſs and folly herein; <hi>De Inventor. Rerum.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 13. And a little before in the ſame Chapter he affirms, <hi>That Images were derived from Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48915:53"/>
               <p> 2. The <hi>Heathen</hi> conſecrated theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Images of their gods with certain Prayers and Ceremonies (before they pay'd any reverence and veneration to them); by vertue whereof they ſuppoſed ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Vertues were acquired to them, and reſided in them. Dan. 3. 2, <hi>Then Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar the King ſent to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Princes, the Governors—to come to the dedication of the Image which Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar the King had ſet up.</hi> So <hi>Arnob. Adv. Gent</hi> lib. 1. lib. 6. &amp; lib. 8. <hi>Minutius Felix in Octav.</hi> Tert. <hi>Apol.</hi> cap. 12. <hi>cum notis</hi> Franc.

               <p>Thus do <hi>Papiſts</hi> conſecrate the Statues and Images of their Saints with certain Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Ceremonies. The manner of this Conſecration is thus deſcribed;</p>

                  <q>Almighty, Everlaſting God, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeſt not the Images and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Saints, that as often as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them with corporal eyes, ſo often we may meditate with the eyes of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to imitate their acts and ſanctity, we beſeech thee vouchſafe to bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, and ſancti <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> fie this Image (or Graving) adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the honour and memory of <hi>B.

               <p>And as the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old did believe, that by the Conſecration of their Images ſome extraordinary Vertues were derived to them; Even ſo do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now, as is moſt clear from theſe following pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Image</hi> of S. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> is conſecrated with theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grant, O Lord, that all beholding with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>

                  <hi>this Image, and pouring out their prayers before it, may be heard in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall ask. Let this Image be the expulſion of Devils, the advocation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the protection of Believers,</hi> &amp;c. Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficale Antiquum apud Rivet.

               <p>And the <hi>Image</hi> of the bleſſed Virgin with theſe words:</p>

                  <hi>O God, ſanctifie this Image of the B.

               <p>Thus our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> blaſphemouſly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> what is proper to the Word of God, and the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That they blot out iniquities, purge away the filth of ſin, obtain pardon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer grace, and defend from all evil.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Heathen</hi> gave great honour and reverence to the <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of their gods, which they expreſſed ſeveral ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By cringing, bowing, and kneeling before them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 18, 44. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. 17. <hi>He maketh a god, and worſhippeth it; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it a graven Image, and falleth down thereto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adorant ſimulachra in terram prostrati,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arnobius,</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles, lib. 6. <hi>Adv. Gent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By kiſſing of them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Yet I have left me ſeven thouſand in Iſrael, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kiſſed him.</hi> Job 31. 27, <hi>And my heart hath been ſecretly enticed, or my mouth hath kiſſed my hand.</hi> Becauſe they could not reach the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> uſed, when they ſaw them ſhine bright, and as it were ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their glory, to lift up their hands to them, and then put them to their mouths,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48915:55"/> by this ſign adoring them as gods. If the things they worſhipped were nigh, they kiſſed them; If out of reach, they put their hands to their mouths, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging they had their breath and life from them. This was a Rite and Ceremony of Adoration among Idolaters. <hi>Minutius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> reports of <hi>Caecilius,</hi> who looking upon the Image of <hi>Serapis,</hi> according to the uſe of the ſuperſtitious Vulgar, he put his hand to his mouth, and kiſſed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Heathen</hi> lighted Candles, and burnt Incenſe before their Images. <hi>Baruch</hi> 6. 19, 21, <hi>They light them Candles, their faces are blacked through the ſmoak—</hi>Their gods are black in the face by the ſmoak (as our <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors expound it) which proceeds from the Incenſe burnt in honour of them. <hi>The Images perfumed and diſcoloured with ſmoak, grow black.</hi> Arnob. <hi>Adv. Gent.</hi> lib. 6. <hi>Macrob. Saturnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Heathen pray'd before their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Iſa. 44. 17, <hi>He falleth down unto it, and ſaith, Deliver me, for thou art my god. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Felix</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles, ſaith, <hi>They invocate their gods, pray before Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The very ſame honour and reverence is given by our <hi>Romanists</hi> to the Images of their Saints.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48915:55"/> 1. They bow and kneel before them, and kiſs them. For this we have the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their much admired Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſ. 25. <hi>We kiſs them, uncover the head, and fall down before them.</hi>

               <p>Thus you ſee, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> give the very ſame honour and adoration to the <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Saints,</hi> which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> did to thoſe of their <hi>gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it is here objected by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, That the <hi>Heathen</hi> worſhipped the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48915:57"/> 
                  <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>gods</hi> abſolutely conſidered, the very <hi>Images</hi> themſelves; but the honor we give them is refer'd to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype</hi> or thing repreſented; inſomuch that by the <hi>Pictures</hi> we kiſs, or before which we kneel, or put off our Hats, we adore Chriſt, and reverence the Saints whom theſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures repreſent.</p>
               <p>But the weakneſs of this Objection will appear, if we conſider theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
               <p>1. That the <hi>Heathen</hi> have often return'd the very Anſwer. They tell us, They are not ſo ignorant, but that they know the power and value of the <hi>Image</hi> before which they fall, which is faſhion'd and fram'd by a Workman. We know (ſay they) that the <hi>Image</hi> is but metal, or ſtone; but as it is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to repreſent ſuch a god, or ſuch a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of god, named <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Juno,</hi> &amp;c. do not think that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and adoration doth terminate there; our thoughts direct our Worſhip to the god, and his Attributes, which we adore in and by ſuch an <hi>Image. Arnobius</hi> brings in the <hi>Heathen</hi> uttering theſe words: <hi>We worſhip the gods by theſe Images.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Thou art deceived, and groſly miſtaken; for we</hi> (the Heathen) <hi>do not believe the ſubſtance of braſs, or ſilver, or gold, or any other thing</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48915:57"/> 
                  <hi>of which theſe Statues are made to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gods; but we worſhip the gods in theſe.</hi> Adv. Gent. lib. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Their great Doctors and Schoolmen tell us, That the very Images are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, yea and with the ſame kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and veneration that is given to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> or perſon repreſented. Their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctor</hi> lays down this concluſion; <hi>That the ſame reverence is to be given to the Image of Chriſt, and to Chriſt himſelf; and by conſequence, ſince Chriſt is adored with the adoration of</hi> Latria <hi>(or divine worſhip) that his Image is to be adored with the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of</hi> Latria. <hi>Pars</hi> 3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 25. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. And <hi>Suarez</hi> affirms, <hi>That the Image may, and ought to be worſhipped with the ſame Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Exemplar.</hi> And this aſſertion he confirms by the teſtimony of <hi>Cajetan, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludanus, Capreolus, Ferrarienſis, Antonius, Soto, Albertus, Ricardus, Bonaventura, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, Almainus, Alex.

Thus 'tis evident, there's a perfect agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the old <hi>Pagans</hi> and our <hi>Romanists,</hi> in the adoration of Images. <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> (a learned Papiſt) confeſſed, <hi>That there could no other difference be found of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh and Popiſh Worſhip before Images, but only this, That Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>athen</hi> placed the Statues and Images of their gods in their Temples. This is ſo clear from all their Hiſtorians, that I need not cite particular Authors.</p>
               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> place the Images of their Saints in their Churches: Which cuſtom (together with the Adoration of them) <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> derives from <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks. Hinc caepimus divorum noſtrorum muta ſimulachra in Templa noſtra traducere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hence we begun to receive the mute Images of our Saints into our Churches, and with great veneration to place them on Gods Altar, which for a man to approach, though the true Image of God, we account</hi> piacular; <hi>we bow the head to them, kiſs them, offer lights, worſhip them, &amp;c.</hi> De Vanitate Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiar. cap. 53.

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48915:58"/>
               <p> 5. To all theſe we may add one more, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Heathen</hi> at a certain time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Images, and omitted to burn Incenſe before them. <hi>Ovid,</hi> who gives us a very large and full account of their Cuſtoms and Ceremonies, ſaith <hi>Faſtor.</hi> lib. 2.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Heathen</hi> appointed Feſtivals in honour of their gods. As <hi>Numa</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Year into Months (ſaith <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius),</hi> ſo every Month into Days; and theſe were called either <hi>Feſti, Profesti,</hi> or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſi.</hi> The <hi>Dies Festi</hi> called alſo <hi>Feriati,</hi> and <hi>Feriae, a feriendo victimas,</hi> Feſtival or Holy-days, were to be ſpent in Religious Rites and Ceremonies. The <hi>Dies Profesti</hi> (ſo called <hi>quaſi procul a festis)</hi> were ſpent in the works of their particular Callings and Secular Employments. The <hi>Dies interciſi (ab intercidendo,</hi> as it were days cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) were half Holy-days; one part of them being appointed for worldly buſineſs, and the other for holy and religious exerciſes: Now the firſt and laſt of theſe days were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to their gods; the firſt wholly, and the laſt in part. Every god had a Feſtival appointed for him, called by his Name, which <hi>Ovid</hi> mentions in his <hi>Fastorum.</hi> The <hi>Saturnalia</hi> were Feſtival-days inſtituted at <hi>Rome</hi> in honour of <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the Month of <hi>December.</hi> The <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> were in honour

That we may obſerve the Law of Retaliation; for they celebrate a Feaſt for us, there being joy in Heaven over a repenting ſinner. 2. Becauſe in honouring them, we do our own work. 3. That we may have them Interceſſors for us. 4. That we may imitate them; for by their Examples we are drawn to walk as they did. 5. For the encreaſe of our ſecurity, and confirmation of our hope.

               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romanists</hi> erect <hi>Altars</hi> to their Saints, as the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Durand</hi> mentions ſome caſes wherein the leſſer <hi>Altars</hi> may, and ought to be re conſecrated; and the ſecond is this: <hi>If the Repoſitory within the Altar be broken, where the Reliques are put, and the Letters Testimonial of its conſecration, ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be kept, containing the Name of the Biſhop by whom it was conſecrated, and the Name of the Saint to whoſe honour it was dedicated,</hi> Ration.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48915:63"/> ſtanding at the dore, he ſaith this Prayer:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>O Lord, we beſeech thee remove from us our iniquities, that we may merit to enter into the Holy of Holies with pure minds; Through, &amp;c.</hi> Amen.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The Biſhop being return'd to the Altar with the Reliques, dippeth his finger in the Chriſm, and ſigneth the Repoſitory or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher where the Reliques are to be kept, with the ſign of the Croſs in four corners, and at every Croſs ſaying:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And then he reverently placeth in it the Veſſel, with the Reliques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes them with hallowed Incenſe: This being done, the Biſhop taketh the Stone, or Table, which is to cover the Sepulcher, and maketh the ſign of the Croſs with his finger dipped in Chriſm in the midſt of it, ſaying:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Let this Table (or this Stone) be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra † ted, and ſancti † fied by this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction. In the Name of the Fa † ther,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, he lays the Table or Stone upon the Sepulcher, and begins this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phona:</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>I heard under the Altar of God the voice of them that were ſlain, ſaying, Why doſt</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48915:63"/> 
                     <hi>thou not judg and avenge our blood? And it was ſaid unto them, Have patience for a little time, till the number of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be compleated.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then the Maſons fix the Table or Stone upon the Sepulcher, with the conſecrated Mortar; after which the Biſhop maketh a Croſs upon it with Chriſm, ſaying:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Let this Altar be ſign † ed, and ſancti † fied. In the Name of the Fa † ther, and of the Son †, and of the Holy † Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, he incenſeth the Altar from the right to the left ſide, before and above: And then follows this prayer:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>We beſeech thee, O Lord, that our prayer may come before thee as incenſe, and all Chriſtian people obtain copious gifts; that whoſoever ſhall devoutly offer ſacrifices to be conſecrated upon this Altar, or receive ſuch as are conſecrated, he may have the helps of this preſent life, and the remiſſion of all ſins, and receive the grace of eternal redemption; Through, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then the Biſhop dips his finger in the holy Oyl, and makes with it five Croſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the midſt, and one in every corner of the Altar, ſaying at every Croſs:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Let this Stone be ſancti † fied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecra † ted: In the Name of the Fa † ther,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>After this, he makes other five Croſſes in the ſame place, repeating the ſame words. And then follows this Prayer, with which I will conclude:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Almighty, Everlaſting God, ſanctifie with the vertue of thy Bened</hi> † <hi>iction, this Altar which we, who are unworthy, conſecrate to thy honour, and the memory of thy Saint</hi> N; <hi>and ſhew the reward of thy help to all that invoke thee here, and truſt in thee; that thou wouldſt vouchſafe to accept the gifts laid upon this Altar; and let the virtue of Sacraments, and the effect of Vows, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; Through Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Amen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many things are here omitted, leſt I ſhould be over-tedious. Give me leave to add a few myſtical ſignifications given by their great <hi>Durand,</hi> of the aforeſaid Ceremonies; and then I will paſs on to the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The four Croſſes made with Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, repreſent the fourfold Charity which all ſhould have that approach the Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> That they love God, themſelves, friends, and enemies. And theſe Croſſes are made in the four corners of the Altar, to ſignifie, 1. That Chriſt by the Croſs hath ſaved the four parts of the World. 2. That four ways we ſhould bear the Croſs of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48915:64"/> Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in the heart by meditation, in the mouth by confeſſion, in the body by mortification, and in the face by continual impreſſion. And the Croſs in the midſt of the Altar denotes the death of Chriſt which he ſuffered in the midſt of the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Biſhop's walking ſeven times about the Altar, ſignifies, 1. His great care and vigilancy. 2. The ſeven Meditations which we ſhould have of the ſeven-fold vertue of Chriſts Humility. 3. The ſeven ways of Chriſt from Heaven to the Virgins Womb, from the Womb to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Altar is ſprinkled ſeven times to denote, <q>1. That in Baptiſm we have ſeven gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. 2. That we ſhould remember the ſeven effuſions of Chriſts blood, <hi>viz.</hi> In Circumciſion, Prayer, when he was whipped, crowned with thorns, had his hands and feet nailed, and his ſide pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The Aſperſory is made of Hyſop, which is an humble herb, to denote the Humility of Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Sepulcher where the Reliques are laid, is conſecrated with four Croſſes made of Chriſm, to ſignifie, That we ſhould have in our hearts the Four Vertues deſcribed in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> viz. <hi>Prudence, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48915:65"/> are laid in the Sepulcher with three grains of Frankincenſe, to denote, That we ſhould keep in memory the Examples of the Saints, with the Faith of the Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </q> The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Altar is incenſed in five places, <hi>viz.</hi> the midſt, and the four corners, to ſignifie, That we ſhould exerciſe our five Senſes, &amp;c.</q>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Heathen</hi> made <hi>Vows</hi> to their gods. The <hi>Gauls</hi> of <hi>Inſubria,</hi> making War againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> vow'd to conſecrate a <hi>golden Chain</hi> to the god of War, to be made of ſuch ſpoils as they took from our Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſaith <hi>Florus,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 4. The <hi>Romans</hi> had their <hi>Votivos Ludos,</hi> which were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in honour of one of their gods, upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48915:66"/> ſome ſpecial Vow made: For whenever they undertook any deſperate War, one of their <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> did vow <hi>Plays</hi> or <hi>Temples</hi> upon condition they got the Victory. The <hi>Vow</hi> was put in writing, and fixed to the <hi>Statue</hi> of the god, with Wax; and this was called <hi>Signare vota. Godwin Roman.</hi> Hiſt. lib. 2. ſect. 3. cap. 9.</p>
               <p>Many forms of theſe Vows we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Briſſonius, Form.</hi> lib. 1. p. 95. And he gives us an account of certain Rites and Ceremonies obſerved in making theſe Vows, p. 107, and 108. The people of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed with a ſore and tedious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine (the effect of unſeaſonable Weather) their Magiſtrates vow'd a yearly Feaſt to their gods if they would make the earth fruitful. <hi>Voſſius de Origin. &amp; progreſſu Idol.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 12.

               <p>Thus do Papiſts make Vows to their Saints. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms, <q>That Vows may be made properly unto Saints, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; but with this diſtinction: We vow to God in ſign of our thankfulneſs to him as unto the <hi>Author</hi> of all good things; but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48915:66"/> to Saints, in ſign of our thankfulneſs to them as our <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>Interceſſors,</hi> by whoſe means we receive theſe good things from God.</q> 
                  <hi>De Cultu Sanctor.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 9. But <hi>Cajetan</hi> goes further, and ſaith, <q>After the ſame manner is the Vow made to God and the Saints; and, We abſolutely vow to Saints, as unto God.</q> And he proves it from the <hi>profeſſion</hi> made by the Brethren of his <hi>Order;</hi> for when they profeſs, they ſay, <q>I vow to God, and the Bleſſed Virgin, and all Saints, That I will be obedient to ſuch and ſuch a Governour—Whereof two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; the one is directed to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that is materially a Vow; the other, which is formally a Vow, to God and the Saints together. And he gives this reaſon, Becauſe they are Gods <hi>participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè.</hi>
                  </q> It were eaſie to give you ſeveral forms of their Vows made to Saints, but I'le only mention that of offering one's ſelf to the B. <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> to be admitted into her <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity. Roſar.</hi> p. 36.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48915:67"/> ſincerity and devotion (in the preſence of my Guardian-Angel, and the whole Court of Heaven) make choice of you for my ſingular Lady, Advocate, and Mother, firmly purpoſing to honour, love, and ſerve you with all filial duty, diligence, and fidelity; and to procure (as much as it ſhall lye in my power) that all others may do the ſame. I therefore moſt heartily beſeech you (O merciful and compaſſionate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) by the precious blood which your dearly beloved Son, my bleſſed Saviour, ſhed for me in his bitter Paſſion, That you will be graciouſly pleaſed to receive and admit me into the number of your devout Clients, as one dedicated to your perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Service.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Be you favourable to me (O Bleſſed Lady), and obtain for me of your All-powerful Son, that I may ſo behave my ſelf in all my thoughts, words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as never more to think, ſpeak, or act any thing diſpleaſing to his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Grant furthermore (O my good and gracious Mother) that I may never forget you, nor forfeit this my now-made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (or Vow) of honouring, loving, and ſerving you all the days of my life; that ſo I may never be forgotten, forſaken nor aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

               <p>And as <hi>Pagans</hi> made Vows to their gods in time of diſtreſs; ſo do <hi>Papiſts</hi> to their Saints. <hi>Turſellin</hi> tells us, <q>That <hi>Laurence Medices,</hi> when oppreſſed by the Arms of <hi>Ziſtus</hi> the Pope, vow'd to the Virgin of <hi>Loretto</hi> a ſilver Statue of great value. <hi>Hiſt. Lauret.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 4. And he relates (cap. 24.) a great danger which Pope <hi>Clement</hi> eſcaped by the protection of this Bleſſed Virgin. The City of <hi>Rome</hi> being taken by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> he retir'd into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Adrians Fort,</hi> where he was cloſely beſieged; and not being able to hold out any longer, he implor'd the help of the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> by a ſolemn Vow, which was to good purpoſe, for ſoon after he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the rage and fury of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</q>

               <p>Their conformity herein with the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, is acknowledged by <hi>Polydor Virgil.</hi> 
                  <q>As often as any part of the body is hurt or diſeaſed; as for example, the head, foot, breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we preſently make vows to God and his Saints, to whom when health is reſtored, we immediately offer that hand, foot, or breaſt, that is, the Image of it made of gold, ſilver, and ſometimes of baſer metal and matter. Concerning which practice, any one that is but modeſtly ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, perhaps will ſay, that he knows not whether we emulate the Religion of the ancient Pagans, or their Superſtition.</q>

They commonly boaſted of Seven ſtately <hi>Structures</hi> that were called, <hi>The Seven Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the World:</hi> The firſt was the <hi>Wall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the pleaſant <hi>Gardens</hi> which Queen <hi>Semiramis</hi> planted; About this Work Three hundred thouſand men were continually employed for many years. The ſecond was the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which Sixteen ſumptuous <hi>Palaces</hi> were built. The third was the <hi>Pyramids</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were of a prodigious height. The fourth was the <hi>Mauſolaeum</hi> of <hi>Caria,</hi> which Queen <hi>Artemiſia</hi> built as a Sepulcher for her decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Husband <hi>Mauſolus.</hi> The fifth was the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which was before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. The ſixth was the <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Olympus,</hi> made by <hi>Phidias,</hi> an hundred and fifty Cubits high. But the greateſt <hi>Wonder,</hi> and moſt incomparable <hi>Work</hi> was the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Diana;</hi> It was 425 foot long, and 220 broad, and 127 ſtately Pillars were in it; Every one of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48915:69"/> them had been the ſole enterpriſe and work of a King. And many other <hi>Temples</hi> very rich and magnificent, were dedicated to the Heathen gods; the Temple of <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and another in the ſame City to <hi>Mars,</hi> where the Judges did meet to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Cauſes of Life and Death. The <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> alſo dedicated to <hi>Neptune, Vulcan, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Aeſculapius, Hercules, Veſta, Janus,</hi> &amp;c. are noted by Authors to have been ſtately <hi>Structures</hi> worthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur: As alſo the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> conſecrated to all the gods. And the <hi>Temples</hi> all over the World were very magnificent. I ſhall not ſtand to name them. It's ſufficient to know, that <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> did employ their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ingenious Inventions of <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> only in the building of <hi>Temples</hi> to their gods.</p>
               <p>That our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> herein agree with the old <hi>Pagans,</hi> is moſt evident, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by their great <hi>Baronius.

Our <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> dedicate Churches to their <hi>Saints;</hi> as to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Denis,</hi> S. <hi>Martin,</hi> S. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> &amp;c. And as the <hi>Pagans</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Pantheon</hi> to all their Gods, ſo do <hi>Papiſts</hi> dedicate Churches to all their Saints. <hi>Durantus</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Pantheon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaith: <hi>That Temple dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Devils, was by</hi> Boniface 4. <hi>with the conſent of the Emperor</hi> Phocas <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the honour of the B. Virgin, and all Saints.</hi> De Ritib. Eccleſ. Cathol. Lib. 1. cap. 4. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> not only ſaith, that Temples are built to God in Honour of the Saints, or that they are called by their Names, though dedicated and conſecrated to God: but affirms, <hi>That theſe ſacred Places are rightly built and dedicated not only to God, but alſo to the Saints.</hi> De Cultu San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Lib. 3. cap. 4. I grant, afterwards he makes a diſtinction <hi>inter Templa &amp; Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licas,</hi> and ſaith; <hi>That they are dedicated to God quâ Templa and to Saints quâ Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae.</hi> But 'tis clear from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> even thoſe cited by him, that theſe Names are <hi>Synonymous:</hi> ſo that this <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a vain ſubterfuge, and meer delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48915:70"/> as if diverſe Names could change the nature of a thing: as if an Adultereſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting her ſelf under ſeveral Names could purge her ſelf from that foul ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Heathen</hi> conſecrated theſe <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> with certain <hi>Prayers</hi> and ſuperſtitious <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were obſerved before the <hi>Temple</hi> was built, of which <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius</hi> hath given us an account. <hi>De Formul.</hi> Lib. 1. p. 113.<hi>—Roſinus Antiquit. Roman. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro in Genial. dier.</hi> Lib. 6. cap. 14. But moſt fully the Learned Dr. <hi>Godwin</hi> in theſe words (moſt of which we find in <hi>Tacitus Hiſtor. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When the <hi>Place,</hi> where the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould be built, had been appointed by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> (which appointing or determining of the Place the called <hi>Effari Templa, &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Fana)</hi> then did the <hi>Party,</hi> which formerly in time of need, upon condition of help from the Gods, had vow'd a <hi>Temple,</hi> call together they <hi>Aruſpices,</hi> which ſhould direct him in what form the Temple ſhould be built; which being known, certain Ribbands and Fillets were drawn about the <hi>Area</hi> or plat of ground, with Flowers and Garlands ſtrewed underneath, as it was probable, to diſtinguiſh the limits of this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48915:70"/> ground now to be hallowed. Then certain Souldiers marched in with boughs in their hands, and after them followed <hi>Veſtal</hi> Nuns leading young Boys and Maids in their hands, who ſprinkled the Place with holy Water. After this followed the <hi>Praetor,</hi> ſome <hi>Pontife</hi> going before, who after the <hi>Area</hi> had been purged by leading round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Sow, a Ram, and a Bull, ſacrificed them, and their entrails being laid upon a turf, the <hi>Praetor</hi> offered up Prayers unto the gods, that they would bleſs thoſe holy Places, which good Men intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate unto them. This being done, the <hi>Praetor</hi> touched certain ropes, wherewith a great ſtone, being the firſt of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was tyed; together with that, other chief Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and all ſorts of people did help to pluck that ſtone, let it down into its place, caſting in wedges of Gold and Silver, which had never been purified, or tried in the fire. Theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies being ended the <hi>Aruſpex</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with a loud voice, ſaying; Let not this work be unhallowed, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſtone or gold into any other uſe.</q> 
                  <hi>Histor. Rom. Lib.</hi> 1. cap. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other Ceremonies were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved after the <hi>Temple</hi> was built. <hi>Fanum</hi> a Temple comes from <hi>fando;</hi> becauſe the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48915:71"/> 
                  <hi>Pontife,</hi> when he conſecrates a Temple, ſpeaketh certain words. <hi>Briſſon. de Form.</hi> Lib. 1. p. 113. And a little after, he ſets down the form of words uſed, and other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies obſerved in the conſecration of their Temples. And that they were conſecrated only by <hi>Pontifes, Durantus</hi> produceth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral teſtimonies out of <hi>Livius, Vopiſcus,</hi> &amp;c. Lib. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>num.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Thus our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> conſecrate the Churches dedicated to their Saints; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not leſs ſuperſtitious than the old <hi>Pagans.</hi> Indeed <hi>Durand</hi> derives this dedication or conſecration from the practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and <hi>Durantus</hi> urgeth the latter as an argument for it. <hi>De Ritib. Eccleſ. Cath. Lib.</hi> 1. cap. 24.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They conſecrate the ground, where the Church is to be built; and the form and manner of it is thus preſcribed in the <hi>Roman Ritual</hi> and <hi>Pontifical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Place being appointed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, where the Church is to be built, the day before the firſt Stone is to be bleſſed or conſecrated, the Biſhop or ſome Prieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by him, fixeth a venerable Croſs of wood, where the Altar is to be erected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The next day the Stone to be laid in the foundation of the Church (which muſt be four ſquare and the Corner ſtone) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48915:71"/> after this manner. The Biſhop, or his Deputy having put on his Robes, and ſtanding in the place where the Church is to be built, bleſſeth the Salt and Water, and while the Clergy is ſinging an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phona,</hi> and <hi>Pſal</hi> 83. ſprinkles the place where the Croſs is ſet with holy Water. The Pſalm being ended, the Biſhop or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, turning himſelf towards the place thus ſprinkled, prayeth:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O Lord God, though Heaven and Earth cannot contain thee, yet thou art pleas'd to have a Houſe upon Earth, where thy Name may be always called upon: We beſeech thee, viſit this place with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene aſpect of thy Piety, the merits of the Bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> ever a Virgin, and <hi>B. N.</hi> (naming the Saint in whoſe Honour and Name the Church ſhall be built) and by the infuſion of thy grace purifie it from all defilement, and being purified preſerve it; and thou who didſt compleat the devotion of thy beloved <hi>David</hi> in the work of his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> vouchſafe to perfect our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in this work, and let all ſpiritual wickedneſs fly away. Through our, <hi>&amp;c. Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then the Biſhop or Prieſt bleſſeth the firſt Stone, ſaying:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O holy Lord, Father Almighty, Eternal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48915:72"/> God, be pleaſed to bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> this Stone to be the foundation of the Church in honour of <hi>S. N.</hi> Through our Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then he ſprinkles the Stone with holy Water, and with a Knife makes the ſign of the Croſs in every part of it, ſaying; in the Name of the Fa † ther, and of the Son †, and of the Holy † Ghoſt. And then this Prayer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Bleſs, O Lord, this Creature of Stone, and grant by the invocation of thy holy Name, that whoſoever ſhall with a pure mind aſſiſt in the building of this Church, may obtain ſoundneſs of body, and health of ſoul.</q> Through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And after ſome other Ceremonies (which I omit for brevity ſake) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or his Deputy toucheth the Stone, and puts it in the foundation, ſaying:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Faith of Jeſu Chriſt, we lay this firſt Stone in this foundation; in the Name of the Fa † ther, and of the Son †, and of the Holy † Ghoſt; that true Faith may flouriſh here, and the fear of God, and brotherly love; and that this place may be deſtinated to Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And when the Maſon hath laid the Stone with Mortar, the Biſhop ſprinkles it with holy Water, ſaying: <hi>Sprinkle me with Hyſop, O Lord, and I ſhall be clean; and</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48915:72"/> 
                     <hi>waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than Snow.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this he ſprinkles every part of the place, where the Church is to be built (if it be not covered); but if it be covered, then he walks round about ſprinkling the foundation of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many other Ceremonies are obſerved and Prayers added, which I muſt paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Pontificale Rom.</hi> p. 199.<hi>—Ritual. Roman.</hi> p. 241.—</p>
               <p>And that they caſt in ſilver and gold with the firſt Stone (as the <hi>Heathen</hi> did) <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> gives us two <hi>Inſtances</hi> out of <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius. De Origine Templor. Lib.</hi> 1. cap. 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They conſecrate the Church after it is built. And that their <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed herein are as ſuperſtitious, idle, and ridiculous, as thoſe of <hi>Pagans,</hi> needs no other proof than the meer relation and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſignification of them. And here I will follow their <hi>Durandus Rational. Divin. Officior.</hi> Lib. 1. cap. 6. and <hi>Durantus de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Eccleſ. Cathol. Lib.</hi> 1. cap. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All being put out the Church, except a Deacon who remains ſhut within, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop halloweth the water mixed with Salt before the door of the Church: and in the mean time twelve <hi>Candles</hi> burn within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48915:73"/> twelve <hi>Croſſes</hi> painted on the Walls. After this, the Biſhop, the Clergy and People following him, goes three times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, and with a Branch of <hi>Hyſop</hi> ſprinkles the Walls with holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and every time coming to the door, ſmites it with his <hi>Paſtoral Staff,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory ſhall come in.</hi> And the Deacon within anſwereth; <hi>Who is this King of Glory?</hi> To whom the Biſhop replies; <hi>The Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battel.</hi> At the third time the door being opened, the Biſhop with a few Miniſters enters the Church, ſaying; <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Then he begins at the left Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to write with his <hi>Paſtoral Staff</hi> on the Pavement, ſprinkled with aſhes, the <hi>Greek Alphabet,</hi> to the right Corner of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and again from the right Corner of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> the whole <hi>Latin Alphabet</hi> to the left Corner of the <hi>West, viz.</hi> in this Form according to the <hi>Roman Pontifical.</hi> p. 222.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48915:73"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <q>Then the Biſhop makes new <hi>Holy-water,</hi> mixed with Salt, Aſhes, and Wine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſprinkles the Altar, Walls, and Pavement of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this he anoints with <hi>Chriſm</hi> the Twelve <hi>Croſſes</hi> painted on the Walls, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let this Temple be ſancti † fied; In the Name of the Fa † ther, and of the Son †, and of the Holy † Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Theſe and other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, the Biſhop celebrates <hi>Maſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then follows the myſtical ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48915:74"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Holy-water</hi> wherewith the Church is ſprinkled, ſignifies <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe the Church after a certain manner is baptized. And the water is mixed with ſalt, to denote our Prudence, which is the condiment of all Vertues, as Salt is of all Meats. Again, the threefold ſprinkling of the Church within &amp; without with this <hi>Holy-water,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the threefold immerſion in <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And this is done for three reaſons: 1. For the expulſion of evil Spirits. 2. For the purgation and expiation of the Church. 3. For the removal of every Malediction. For the Earth from the beginning was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a curſe, becauſe man fell by its fruit; but the Water was under no curſe; Hence our Saviour did eat fiſh, and we do not read that he ate fleſh, except of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb.</hi> And this ſprinkling in their going about the Church, ſignifies the care that God hath of his, who ſends his Angel to guard thoſe that fear him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Biſhops thrice going about the Church, denotes our Saviour's threefold <hi>Circuit</hi> for the ſanctification of the Church: The firſt was, when he came from Heaven to Earth. The ſecond, when he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Earth into <hi>Limbus.</hi> The third, when he aſcended from thence into Heaven.</q> 
                  <q>It alſo ſignifies the threefold ſtate of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48915:74"/> thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> Virgins, Continent, and Married perſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. <q>The twelve lighted <hi>Candles</hi> ſignifie (according to <hi>Rabanus Maurus)</hi> the twelve <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> or (according to <hi>Ivo)</hi> that the ſhining and burning light of the Apoſtles is to be commended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. <q>The Biſhop's thrice ſmiting of the door with his <hi>Paſtoral Staff,</hi> ſhews that the Powers of Heaven, Earth, and Hell, yield unto him; and that Chriſt hath a threefold right to his Church. Again, by this threefold ſmiting of the door with his <hi>Staff,</hi> is underſtood the preaching of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And the opening of the door de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, that by the preaching of Paſtors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels are converted to the Faith. The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's <hi>Interrogation, Who is the King of Glory?</hi> ſignifies the peoples ignorance of Chriſt. And the Biſhop knocks thrice, Becauſe that is the moſt noted and ſacred Number; and becauſe without the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> there is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. <q>The door being opened, the Biſhop enters, to note, that nothing is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his <hi>Office.</hi> when rightly executed; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Lord, who can reſiſt thy power?</hi> And he enters the Church with two or three, that in the mouth of two
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48915:75"/> or three <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> every word of <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi> may be confirmed; or becauſe few were preſent when Chriſt in his <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> pray'd for the Church. And when the <hi>Biſhop</hi> is entred, he ſaith, <hi>Peace be to this Houſe,</hi> becauſe Chriſt came into the world to make peace between God and Man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>5. <q>The Biſhop begins at the left corner of the Eaſt, and goes to the right corner of the Weſt; and then at the right corner of the Eaſt, to the left of the Weſt, writing on the <hi>Pavement,</hi> ſprinkled with aſhes, the whole <hi>Alphabet</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin:</hi> 1 By the <hi>Alphabet</hi> we are to underſtand the firſt <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. 2.

And on the 17 of <hi>February</hi> (or then-about) was celebrated the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Concordia,</hi> which <hi>Camillus</hi> vowed upon a great diſſention in <hi>Rome</hi> between the <hi>Senat</hi> &amp; common people, ſaith the ſame <hi>Author,</hi> p. 52</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> built a Temple to <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the day of its Conſecration
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48915:77"/> was yearly obſerved by the <hi>Romans</hi> as a great <hi>Feſtival.</hi> And ſo was the Dedication of the Temple to <hi>Jupiter Victor,</hi> to the Mother of the Gods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Learned <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> proves out of their own <hi>Authors.</hi> On theſe days they feaſted, ſported—after their religious <hi>Rites</hi> were over.</p>

               <p>1. THE <hi>Heathen</hi> offered <hi>Gifts</hi> unto their gods. This hath been ſufficiently cleared in ſeveral <hi>Instances;</hi> yet a few more I will add in this place. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor offer'd unto <hi>Juno</hi> a <hi>Peacock,</hi> her beloved <hi>Bird,</hi> of pure Gold, with wings round about; at the Extremities he cauſed all manner of ſparkling and precious Stones to be put, that they might ſerve in lieu of eyes, and repreſent the perfect form of a <hi>Peacock, Marius d' Aſſigni,</hi> p. 21. The <hi>Gauls</hi> of <hi>Inſubria</hi> promiſed to offer the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> to <hi>Vulcan;</hi> but (ſaith <hi>Florus)</hi> it fell out otherwiſe: for <hi>Verduma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> their King was ſlain, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> hung the third <hi>Opima,</hi> that is, magnificent and pompous ſpoils, which ſince the reign of <hi>Romulus</hi> had been offered to <hi>Jupiter, Feretrius. Histor. Roman.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 4. In a word the old <hi>Romans</hi> upon every emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deliverance offer'd very ſplendid <hi>Gifts</hi> to that god who was the ſuppoſed <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>

                  <q>The Prieſts and others (ſaith he) who reaped the Profit, excited the <hi>People</hi> to offer liberally, whoſe Gifts they hung in publick places, and added Titles to them, that ſo the <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> might be better known both to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to Men. Thus a great part of the people were induced ſometimes to make long journeys, that they might viſit ſuch an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> and leave their <hi>Gifts</hi> there: and in ſo doing they thought enough was done, though all other duties both of piety and charity were omitted. <hi>De Inventor.

               </p>

               <p>THE <hi>Heathen</hi> offered <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their gods.

Here a choice was made of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> according to the diſpoſition of the gods to whom the Sacrifice was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. For <hi>Mars</hi> loved no creatures but only ſuch as were furious and warlike; as the <hi>Bull,</hi> which might not be ſacrificed to <hi>Jupiter. Neptune</hi> affected the <hi>Horſe</hi> and the <hi>Bull:</hi> the <hi>He-goat</hi> was dedicated to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> becauſe it is a creature that ſpoils the Vineyards. <hi>Cows</hi> were kill'd in honour of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Juno.

               <p>Nay, in ſome places they ſacrificed Men and Women to their Idols. <hi>Bacchus</hi> had an Altar in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> upon which a great many young Damſels were beaten to death with bundles of Rods. This was alſo practiſed by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who ſcourged their Children in honour of <hi>Mercury.</hi> The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the <hi>Cimbri</hi> alſo ſacrificed men after they had cruelly tormented them. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truchius Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries ſpeaks of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> who did trim up a great Statue made of branches of <hi>Ozier,</hi> and then filled it with men alive, to burn them together to their Idols. <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> makes mention of <hi>Aristome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who in a Sacrifice cauſed three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men to be ſlain in honour of his god.</p>
               <p>Many of them did offer their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which was an ordinary practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48915:83"/> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the people of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina.</hi> The Holy Scripture doth reproach it to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were ſo vile as to imitate theſe abominable Inhumanities in cauſing their Children to paſs between two fires ſo often, till they were miſerably ſcorched. They alſo ſhut them up in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Idol of Braſs called <hi>Molech,</hi> which was red hot; and whilſt theſe innocent <hi>Victims</hi> were conſuming in this manner, they ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trumpets, and beat Drums and other Inſtruments, that the people might not hear the complaints and outcries of theſe poor Creatures; therefore this place was called <hi>Tophet,</hi> that is, a Drum.</p>
               <p>Thus do <hi>Papists</hi> offer Sacrifices in honour of their Saints. <q>When a perſon is cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd, there's a ſeven-fold honour (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> due unto him. 1. He is put into the <hi>Catalogue of Saints,</hi> that is, 'tis decreed and commanded, that he be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly eſteemed and called a <hi>Saint</hi> by all men. 2. He is invocated in the publick prayers of the Church. 3. <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> are built in honour of him. 4. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> as well of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as of <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> are publickly offered in honour of him. 5. <hi>Holy-days</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in memory of him. 6.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48915:83"/> painted with a certain light, in ſign of that glory he's believ'd to have in Heaven. 7. His <hi>Reliques</hi> are kept in a precious <hi>Box,</hi> and publickly reverenced. <hi>De Sanctor. Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titud. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</q>

               <p>THE <hi>Heathen</hi> taught, that there is a place in the lower parts of the Earth, where the Souls of men are purged from the ſpots of leſſer ſins, by ſuffering moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous torments, before they can be admittted into the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> places that abound with all manner of <hi>delights</hi> and <hi>ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

                     </gap>) that in paſſion have offer'd violence to Father or Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſpent the reſt of their lives in <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> theſe according to the nature of their crimes are caſt into divers Rivers of Fire, where they lie for a year or more, and then come to a <hi>Fenny, Mariſh place,</hi> called <hi>Acheruſia,</hi> where they pray unto thoſe, whom they have hurt and injur'd, that they may come forth, and be received into the Manſions of Bliſs and Happineſs. If their Prayers and Supplications prevail with theſe perſons, they preſently come forth, and ceaſe to be tormented. But thoſe who have lived vertuouſly, aſcend into moſt pure habitations, the beauty and glory of which is not eaſie to be expreſſed. And others, who have liv'd in a middle way, they are carried along the <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> to a Fenny place, where they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and abſolved by ſuffering grievous torments; and being delivered thence, they are rewarded with honours according to the merit and dignity of their good works. <hi>Phaedo propè finem.</hi> Again, in his <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> he ſaith: Thoſe that have lived juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And 'tis obſervable, that <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaking of the two places, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Bleſſed, and of the Damned, he ſaith; <hi>Theſe things I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition:</hi> but when he comes to ſpeak of a third and middle <hi>ſtate</hi> of the dead, he endeavours to demonſtrate it by reaſon; <q>As theſe (ſaith he) who are puniſhed for their offences in this life, are ſo puniſhed, that they may either receive the profit of reformation, or be an example to others: So it is in the other world; theſe who have committed ſins that are curable, receive benefit by pains and torments; But thoſe, who for the greatneſs of their crimes are incurable (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) nothing can profit them, but they become an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another reaſon which he urgeth is purely <hi>Philoſophical;</hi> 
                  <q>As the body retains its marks, ſcars and deformities, even after death; ſo vices impreſs blots and ſtains upon the ſoul; when therefore <hi>Radaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48915:85"/> (one of the <hi>Judges</hi> of Hell) ſeeth the ſoul, when ſeparated from the body, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with ſpots, he judgeth whether they be curable or incurable. And therefore I ſtudy (ſaith he) to appear before his Judgment-ſeat having a ſoul altogether pure and holy.</q> And the ſame Doctrine is delivered by him, <hi>De Repub.</hi> lib. 10.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Plato</hi> made up three degrees of men; The eminently vertuous, whom he lodgeth in the <hi>Elyſian-Fields;</hi> the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, whom he adjudgeth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire; and the middle ſort, who have committed ſome light and venial ſins, and theſe his <hi>Purgatory</hi> is reſerved for.</p>

               <p>I confeſs thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> do ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature of it, <hi>Seſs.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> 30. <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſhall affirm, That the guilt of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment is ſo forgiven, as that there remains no guilt of temporal puniſhment to be paid either in this life, or hereafter in Purgatory, before there can be any entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, let him be</hi> Anathema.</p>
               <p>From whence it evidently follows, That
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48915:86"/> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as 'tis deliver'd by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> doth depend upon this <hi>Principle,</hi> That there is a guilt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment remaining after the ſin is pardoned, which temporal puniſhment is to be ſatisfied for either in this life, or in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> So that all thoſe who are in <hi>Purgatory</hi> are there on that account, that they might ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for the temporal puniſhment of ſin. For the guilt of mortal ſin being remitted by the merits of Chriſt, the puniſhment is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtill to remain; which being changed from eternal to temporal by the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Church, this puniſhment remains to be ſatisfied for in the pains of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more fully is this <hi>place</hi> deſcribed by their <hi>Doctors. Bellarmine</hi> gives us this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it: <hi>Purgatory is a certain place, where, as in a priſon, ſouls are purged, that were not perfectly cleanſed and purified in this life, before they can be admitted into Heaven.</hi> De Purgator. lib. 1. cap. 1.</p>
               <p>They tell us, That all ſouls are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but only thoſe for whom Heaven is prepar'd; and not all theſe, for ſome have an immediate paſſage into Heaven: 1. Such as have no pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defilement at all; which privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg (ſay they) is proper to the <hi>Virgin</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48915:87"/> 
                  <hi>Mary.</hi> 2. Such as have no actual ſin, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and S. <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> 3. Such whoſe ſins, whether <hi>venial</hi> or <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> are fully expiated. For whom then is this place prepared? I anſwer, For ſuch as have not (though they are truly penitent, and firmly believe in Chriſt) fully ſatisfied for their ſins, or undergone ſufficient <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panigarolla</hi> confidently affirms, <q>That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: And he proves it thus; Suppoſe three men dye; one without ſin both <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> and <hi>venial;</hi> the ſecond with both; and the third without <hi>mortal,</hi> but with <hi>venial ſin.</hi> The firſt paſſeth immediately to Heaven; and the ſecond to Hell. But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goes the third? If to Heaven, God is unjuſt in conferring the ſame Reward which the firſt enjoyeth. If to Hell, God is unjuſt in inflicting the ſame puniſhment upon him which the ſecond ſuffereth: Therefore he muſt go into Purgatory, to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and to have his ſoul thorowly purified.</q> 
                  <hi>Apud</hi> Chamier. <hi>de Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator.</hi> cap. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If ſuch as be truly penitent, dye in Gods favour before they have ſatisfied for their ſins of omiſſion and commiſſion, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy fruits of penance, their ſouls are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               <p>I cannot diſmiſs this head, till I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you an account of the manifold Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which their great <hi>Durand</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in theſe <hi>Bells,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> us'd in the conſecration of them.</p>

                  <q>They are made of <hi>braſs,</hi> and ſo more ſhril than <hi>Trumpets</hi> under the <hi>Law;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then God was known in <hi>Judea</hi> only, but now thorow the world.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, theſe <hi>Bells</hi> denote <hi>Preachers,</hi> which, like to <hi>Bells,</hi> ought to call men to the <hi>Faith.</hi> The <hi>Bell</hi> it ſelf denotes the mouth of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>I am become as ſounding-braſs,</hi> &amp;c. The hardneſs of the metal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes fortitude in the mind of the <hi>Preacher;</hi> hence ſaith God, <hi>I have given thee a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head more hard than their foreheads.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Clapper,</hi> which, ſtriking on both ſides of the Bell, makes the ſound; denotes the

                     <hi>Doctors</hi> tongue, which is adorned with knowledg, and publiſheth both the <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> A <hi>Prelate</hi> therefore without abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to preach, is like a <hi>bell</hi> without a <hi>clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> And the ſtriking of the <hi>clapper</hi> on both ſides the <hi>bell,</hi> ſignifies that a <hi>Preacher</hi> ought firſt to ſmite Vice in himſelf by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and afterwards proceed to reprove it in others.</q>

                  <q>The <hi>band</hi> wherewith the <hi>clapper</hi> is ti'd to the <hi>bell,</hi> denotes the moderation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the tongue is temper'd. The Wood in which the <hi>bell</hi> hangeth, ſignifies the wood of the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt. The Iron <hi>ligatures</hi> which tye and faſten the <hi>bell</hi> to the wood, denote Charity, by which the <hi>Preacher</hi> being inſeparably conjoin'd to the Croſs, glorieth, ſaying, <hi>Far be it from me to glory, except in the Croſs of our Lord.</hi> The <hi>wheel</hi> by which the <hi>bell</hi> is toll'd, ſignifies the right mind of the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> which being wholly addicted to the Divine Laws, he preſſeth them upon the people by continual preaching.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>rope</hi> wherewith the <hi>bell</hi> is tolled, denotes the humility or life of the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi> Again, the <hi>rope</hi> is ty'd to the <hi>wood</hi> in which the <hi>bell</hi> hangeth, to ſignifie that the Scripture deſcendeth from the <hi>wood</hi> of the holy <hi>Croſs;</hi> and as the Rope is made
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48915:99"/> of three <hi>cords,</hi> ſo the Scripture conſiſteth of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> viz. <hi>Hiſtory, Allegory,</hi> and <hi>Morality.</hi> And the <hi>rope</hi> deſcending from the <hi>wood</hi> in the <hi>Prieſts</hi> hand, is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcending from the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in the mouth of the <hi>Preacher;</hi> and it comes to his hand, becauſe the Scripture ſhould produce good works. The riſing and falling of the <hi>Rope</hi> in tolling or ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>bell,</hi> denotes that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes ſpeaks of high, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of low matters; or, that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſometimes preacheth <hi>mysteriouſly,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>plainly,</hi> according to the capacity of the people. Again, the <hi>Priest</hi> pulls the <hi>Rope</hi> downward, when he deſcends from contemplation to action; and upward, when the Scripture is exalted in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>
                  <q>Three things (ſaith <hi>Durand)</hi> are here obſervable, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſhaving of the Head, cropping the hair and the circular Form.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1. <q>Three things follow upon the ſhaving of the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſervation of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, deformation, and denudation. 1. The conſervation of cleanlineſs; becauſe from the hair filthineſs is contracted in the head. 2. Deformation; becauſe hair is for an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore this ſhaving ſignifieth an undefiled and ſingular life: that Clergy-men ſhould have purity of ſoul within; and a ſingular life, that is, no exquiſite habit without: Further, the ſhaving and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the hair denotes the depoſition of all temporal things, and that they ſhould be content with food and raiment. 3. The
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48915:104"/> baring of the upper part of the head, ſhews that there ſhould be nothing betwixt us and God, that with open face we may contemplate the Divine Glory. Again, we ſhave the head, ſome hair being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the form of a Crown; becauſe the head ſignifieth the mind; and the hair, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thoughts. Therefore as the top of the head is cleanſed from hair; ſo the mind, whilſt it meditateth on heavenly things, ought to be cleanſed from worldly thoughts. But the lower part of the head hath hair, becauſe 'tis ſometimes lawful to think of worldly things, without which we cannot live.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. The cropping of the hair denotes, That no ſuperfluous thoughts ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the mind. They go with ſhaven heads and naked ears, leſt their hair by growing long, cover their ears, and hinder their ſight; to ſignifie, that no worldly thoughts ſhould ſtop the ears or eyes of the Soul. And the hair is cut above the ears, that the five ſenſes of the head may be ready for the ſervice of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. The hair is ſhaven in a <hi>circular form,</hi> or like a <hi>crown,</hi> for ſeveral reaſons: 1. In imitation of Chriſt our King, who being about to offer up himſelf upon the Altar of the Croſs, did wear a Crown of thorns.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48915:105"/> Hence 'tis, that we, deſiring to be ſaved by his Death, do wear upon our heads the <hi>Sign</hi> of Chriſts <hi>paſſion,</hi> that is, the form of a <hi>thorny Crown,</hi> which he wore in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that he might take away the thorns of our ſins: and to ſhew that we are ready to ſuffer deriſions and reproaches for him, as he was for us. 2. The <hi>circular form</hi> of the hair denotes the vertue of equality, every way agreeable to reaſon: For then tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things are rightly meditated on, when they are conſonant to reaſon. 3. A <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Figure</hi> is made becauſe this Figure hath neither beginning nor end: by which we are given to underſtand, that <hi>Clerks</hi> are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God, who had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſhall have no end. 4. This <hi>figure</hi> hath no corner; by which is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that <hi>Clergy-men</hi> ought not to have a ſpot in their lives, and that they ſhould have truth in their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> becauſe Truth loves not <hi>corners.</hi> 5. Becauſe this <hi>figure</hi> of all figures is moſt beautiful: Hence in this God made the <hi>celestial</hi> creatures; by which is ſignified, that <hi>Clerks</hi> ought to have beauty within in the Soul, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the converſation. 6. Becauſe this <hi>figure</hi> is the moſt ſimple: For according to S. <hi>Austin,</hi> no figure is conſtituted of one line only, except a <hi>circular;</hi> by which is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48915:105"/> intimated, that Clergy-men ſhould have a Dove-like ſimplicity; according to that, <hi>be ye ſimple as Doves.</hi> 7. A Crown ſhews, that Clerks are in a peculiar reſpect the Kingdom of God.</q> Theſe are the doughty Reaſons given by <hi>Durand</hi> and others for this <hi>circular form,</hi> which my deſigned bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity will not ſuffer me to make ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant remarks upon.</p>
               <p>And then he proceeds to the ſhaving of their <hi>beards;</hi> where alſo this acute Doctor diſcovers as great Myſteries as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reaſon of hair on the Beard (ſaith he) is the ſuperfluity of humors in the ſtomack; this denotes, That we ſhould cut off thoſe vices and ſins which are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous in us. We ſhave our Beards, that by Innocence and Humility we may appear pure and undefiled; and be like unto the Angels, which are always freſh and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Yet in times of faſting, we ſuffer five hairs to grow, becauſe all thoughts which are not againſt God, as to build a Church, till the ground, and ſuch-like, which we uſe to have in times of Abſtinence, ſhould not be prohibited.</q> I wiſh this great <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologiſt</hi> had explicated theſe laſt words, that the reaſon might have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to poor <hi>Hereticks.</hi>

                  <q>Laſtly, Where a certain number of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles is not obſerved, there they ſignifie the Prophets, and other holy Fathers, who foretelling Chriſt our Light, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of Salvation, are now dead, being tormented with divers pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments. Further, All the Candles are not put out together, but one after another, becauſe the <hi>Diſciples</hi> left Chriſt ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and not all at once. Some extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a Candle after every Canticle, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that our joy was turned into ſorrow, becauſe the true <hi>Sun</hi> was ſet. Others put them out at three times, in remembrance of Chriſts three days burial. In ſome Churches the Candles are put out with a <hi>Wax hand</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">O the wit of man.</note>, which ſignifies the hand of <hi>Judas,</hi> which was as it were of Wax, that is, flexible to evil; by which Chriſt our King, and true Light, was betrayed, and, as much as in him lay, extinguiſhed. The Candle in the midſt is not put out, but kept burning in a Cheſt or Corner, that afterwards it may be brought forth, and enlighten the Church. And this Candle ſignifies 1. The <hi>Faith</hi> which remained only in the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> by whom all the <hi>Elect</hi> are taught and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. 2. It ſignifies Chriſt, who though he ſeemed according to his <hi>fleſh</hi> extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48915:108"/> yet according to his <hi>Divinity,</hi> which was hid from them, he lived; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards riſing with moſt glorious light, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf to his Diſciples. 3. The bringing forth of the Candle which ſeemed to be put out, notes the illumination of <hi>Faith</hi> in the Apoſtles and others, in whom it was then almoſt extinct. 4. It denoteth Faith after Infidelity. 5. It ſignifies, that the fire of the holy Spirit, which ſeems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in <hi>Believers,</hi> ſhines forth again in them. 6. The renewing of the <hi>Light,</hi> ſignifieth, the renovation of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> 7. The Lights are put out ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively one after another; and one is as it were put out, becauſe covered; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards brought forth, to note, That the perverſe <hi>dreſſers</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, have ſlain the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> viz. the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and at laſt his <hi>Heir,</hi> whoſe <hi>burial</hi> is ſignified by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection</hi> by the bringing of it forth. And the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle laſt put out, according to ſome, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the reſt, and ſignifies Chriſt, who was Lord of the Prophets; and according to others, where the Candle is equal with the reſt, it alſo ſignifieth Chriſt, who was reputed one of the Prophets; and the laſt extinguiſhed, becauſe after him there was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48915:109"/> no Prophet. And laſtly, The Candle it ſelf is put out at the <hi>Evangelical Canticle;</hi> becauſe Chriſt was ſlain preaching the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, Ration. Divin. Officior.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 72.</q>

               </l>
               <p>It was the general practice (as <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> teſtifieth) to worſhip the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48915:110"/> gods towards the <hi>East; In Genial. Dierum. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Hence their <hi>Temples</hi> were built <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> as <hi>Vitruvius, Plutarch,</hi> and others have affirmed. Nay, they thought no <hi>luſtration</hi> was lawful, except that which was done by thoſe that turned to the <hi>East,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cratinus</hi> in <hi>Chirone</hi> apud <hi>Natal. Comit. Mythol. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romanists</hi> worſhip towards the <hi>East:</hi> and for this their famous <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> urgeth ſeveral arguments. As 1. <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was ſeated in the <hi>East, Gen.</hi> 2. Therefore we pray towards the <hi>East,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we profeſs our ſelves <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and long for our <hi>Country,</hi> out of which we were ejected by ſin. 2. Becauſe the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> begin to move from the <hi>East;</hi> hence 'tis that that part of the world is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. And therefore, when we pray, we turn our <hi>corporal</hi> face to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Body,</hi> that we may be admoniſhed to turn our ſpiritual face to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is God. 3. Becauſe Chriſt, whom we invocate, is the Light of the World; and therefore to ſignifie, that we are illuminated by Chriſt, the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs, as they are by the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Sun,</hi> who look towards the <hi>East,</hi> we uſe this <hi>Ceremony.</hi> 4. Becauſe our Lord was crucified on the <hi>Croſs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48915:110"/> the <hi>Weſt;</hi> therefore we pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>East,</hi> that we may look him in the face.</q> Theſe moſt convincing <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are urged by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and many other <hi>Roman Doctors</hi> for this <hi>Cuſtom:</hi> But their <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſeth that it was derived from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> De <hi>Inventor.

And <hi>Pope Leo</hi> 3. acknowledgeth that this practice ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of a <hi>Pagan</hi> ſpirit, and ought not to be tolerated among Chriſtians. <q>From ſuch <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> this impiety hath proceeded, that the <hi>Sun,</hi> when it riſeth in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is adored from high places by ſimple people: which alſo ſome Chriſtians do, and they think ſo religiouſly, that before they come to the Church of <hi>Bleſſed Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, having paſſed the <hi>Steps</hi> to the <hi>High Altar,</hi> they <note place="margin">Though <hi>Baſil</hi> made worſhipping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt an ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lib. de Spir.

                  <hi>Almighty, Everlaſting God, we humbly implore thine immenſe Clemency, that thou wouldſt vouchſafe to bleſs</hi> † <hi>and ſancti</hi> † <hi>fy with thy piety this Creature of Salt, which thou hast given for the uſe of Mankind, that it may be health both of mind and body to all that receive it: and that every thing toucbed or ſprinkled with it, may be delivered from all uncleanneſs and ſuggeſtions of ſpiritual wickedneſs.</hi> Through our Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to <hi>exorcize</hi> the Water with theſe words: <hi>I exorcize thee, O Creature of Water, in the Name of God</hi> † <hi>the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and in the Name of Jeſu</hi> † <hi>Christ, his</hi>

                  <hi>Son our Lord, and in the power of the Holy</hi> † <hi>Ghost: that thou become exorcized Water to drive away all power of the Enemy.</hi> And then he ſaith this Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O God, who for the ſalvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hast made the greatest Sacraments in the ſubstance of water; Be thou propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent to our prayers; and pour upon this Element, prepared with many purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the virtue of thy Benedic</hi> † <hi>tion, that this Creature ſerving thy Mysteries, may through thy grace be effectual to drive away the Devil and all diſeaſes; that all things in the houſes or places of the faithful which ſhall be ſprinkled therewith, they may be freed from all uncleanneſs, and whatever is hurtful; let no evil ſpirit lodg there, no pestilential breath; let all the wiles of the ſecret Enemy depart; and if there be any thing hurtful to the quiet and ſafety of the Inhabitants, let it depart upon the ſprinkling of this water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After this, he puts Salt into the water in the form of a Croſs, ſaying, <hi>Let this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of ſalt and water be as aforeſaid. In the Name of the Fa</hi> † <hi>ther, and of the Son</hi>

               <p>Thus our <hi>Romanists</hi> attribute extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Virtues to their <hi>Holy-water. Coſterus</hi> tells us, <q>That the Virtues of <hi>Holy-water</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late both to ſoul and body. 1. To the Soul, and they are ſeven. 1. By the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Holy-water,</hi> Devils are expell'd out of places, perſons, and things. 2. Sins are remitted. 3. <hi>Phantaſms,</hi> evil thoughts and diſtractions of mind in prayer, and at other
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48915:115"/> times, are excluded. 4. Our hearts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from earthly things. 5. Our ſouls are diſpoſed to prayer and devotion. 6. The grace, favour, and preſence of the Holy Spirit are obtained. 7. Mens minds are better prepared to underſtand Divine <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For this aſperſion of <hi>Holy-water</hi> is of force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every thing that may hinder the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and for this cauſe 'tis uſed in the conſecration of Altars and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that from theſe places every impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of prayer and devotion may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. 2. To the Body; and they are four: 1. The barrenneſs of men, beaſts, and human things, is cured. 2. Great plenty of good things is obtained. 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the body are both prevented and removed. 4. The noxious air is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the Peſtilence, and every Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, expelled, <hi>Apud Hoſpin. de Templis.</hi>

               <p>4. The Heathen ſprinkled their Houſes, Fields, Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>luſtral</hi> water.

               <p>And if the Houſe be new built, they ſay this Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We humbly beſeech thee, O God, Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, for this houſe, and the perſons and things in it, that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to bleſs</hi> †, <hi>and ſancti</hi> † <hi>fie it, and beſtow all good things upon it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Their Beds, ſaying this Prayer:</p>

                  <hi>Bleſs</hi> † <hi>O Lord, this Bed, that all who lye in it may be in thy peace, and remain in thy favour, and grow old, and at laſt arrive at the Kingdom of heaven; Through Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Rituale Romanum de Benedictioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Faithful may take Holy-water in Veſſels, and carry it home to ſprinkle ſick perſons, their Fields, Vines, and other things, ſaith the ſame <hi>Ritual de Exorciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Aquae Benedictae.</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48915:117"/> Images were made and expoſed to ſale on the foreſaid days, <hi>In Genial. Dier.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 4.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Baronius</hi> mentions certain Bulls <hi>(bullas)</hi> different at leaſt in form from the other, which were ſuperſtitiouſly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had extraordinary Virtues attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; and therefore were hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the necks of their Children, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from Enchantments and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Annal.

               <p>Thus do Papiſts hang little Images about their necks, which they call <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and attribute extraordinary Virtues to them.

               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> at this day in their pretended honouring the ancient <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whoſe Religion and Practices they perſecute in the true <hi>Profeſſours;</hi> And their conformity herein with the old <hi>Pagans</hi> will appear in theſe following Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Heathen</hi> carefully kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the <hi>Reliques</hi> of their deceaſed <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,</hi> that is, Men eminent for Vertue, and noble Exploits. When their <hi>Bodies</hi> were burnt (which <hi>Cuſtom</hi> was generally obſerved in moſt Countries) they carefully gathered their <hi>Bones</hi> and <hi>Aſhes. Kirchman</hi> handling this Queſtion; How the <hi>Aſhes</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi> of thoſe, to whom they would give honour, could be diſcerned from the aſhes of the Wood, and the bones of Animals, which were often burnt with them? He anſwers;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>Some think, That they made Garments of <hi>Indian Flax,</hi> which could not be burnt, and that their <hi>Bodies</hi> were covered with them, that their Bones and Aſhes might be kept ſeparate; But this <hi>Opinion</hi> he rejects.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48915:121"/>
               <p> 2. He anſwers with <hi>Iſaac Cauſabon,</hi> 
                  <q>That the dead Body to be burnt, was ſo placed in the <hi>Pyra,</hi> that its bones and aſhes might remain ſeparate, and not be mingled with the aſhes and bones of ſuch things and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were burnt with it; and hence 'twas, that they could diſtinguiſh them, <hi>De Funeribus Roman.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 7.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as theſe bones and aſhes were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gathered, ſo they were with no leſs care preſerved; for after they were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Wine, and perfumed with Odors, they put them into a golden ſilver-pot or coffin. <hi>Aelian</hi> writing of <hi>Severus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, ſaith, <q>That his Body was tranſlated from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in great pomp, though ſome ſay, 'twas only a golden Pot containing his <hi>Reliques.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> carefully keep the <hi>Reliques</hi> of their <hi>Saints;</hi> Are they not put into Cheſts of Gold, Silver—and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lock and key?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> reverence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Reliques of their Saints. This is clear, 1. From their Principles. 2. From

               <p>2. From their Practices. Let us hear <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s ingenuous Confeſſion: <q>In theſe laſt times too much is attributed to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> and <hi>Memories</hi> of Saints; inſomuch as the better ſort of men, and thoſe that were moſt zealous, have placed the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it were, of Religion, in ſearching out ſuch Reliques, adorning them with Gold and Jewels, and building Temples and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48915:123"/> Memorials for them; and the worſer and wickeder ſort have repos'd falſe confidence in the fooliſh and ſuperfluous worſhipping of them, <hi>Conſult. de Reliquiis.</hi>
                  </q> Here we ſee the practice both of the better and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of people; the one eſteeming it the chiefeſt part of Religion, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying wholly upon it as the only means of purging away their ſins; and many ways do they expreſs their reverence and veneration to theſe Reliques.</p>

               <p>THAT the <hi>Heathen</hi> arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power to caſt out Devils (as our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do) is clear from their own Hiſtorians, and the Confeſſions both of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers. I will briefly remark the Methods and Ceremonies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them in their <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> and ſhew how far our preſent Adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> ſymbolize with them. The Ways and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, Rites and Ceremonies obſerved by the Heathen, may be reduced unto two Heads, viz. <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Heathen</hi> uſed certain <hi>words</hi> in their <hi>Exorciſms.

               <p n="2">2. The Heathen uſed certain <hi>Things</hi> in their <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> as Herbs, Fumigations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, That the Heathen caſt out Devils by Herbs, Stones, certain Animals, Sounds, Voices, and Figures, <hi>De Civit.

And lib. 21. cap. 6, he ſaith, Devils are enticed and allured by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kinds of Herbs, Animals, Charms and Ceremonies. <q>I ſaw a certain private man (ſaith <hi>Joſephus)</hi> amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that cured divers poſſeſſed of Devils, in the preſence of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> his Sons, Tribunes, and Soldiers.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48915:132"/> whereof was a kind of Root, diſcovered by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which drew out the Devil through the noſtrils of the Poſſeſſed, as ſoon as he ſmelled at it, <hi>Antiq.</hi> lib. 8. cap. 2.</q> And the ſame Hiſtorian mentions the Herb or Root uſed in their <hi>Exorciſms.</hi> 
                  <q>On the North-ſide of the City there's a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Baaras,</hi> where alſo groweth a root of the ſame name; the colour whereof reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the flame, and it ſhineth at night like the Sun-beams, and is not eaſie to be pulled up, till that one caſt upon it the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of a Woman, or her Flowers; which being done, whoſoever toucheth it, is ſure to dye, except he carry the root hanging on his hand. And a little after he adds; This Herb, notwithſtanding all this danger, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſought out for the virtue it hath; for it driveth away Devils out of mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if it be but applied unto them, <hi>De Bello Judaico,</hi> lib. 7. cap. 25.</q> And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us, That this way of ejecting Devils, was like to that of the Gentiles, <hi>In Dial. cum Tryphon.</hi> And the ſame is affirmed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> Hiſt. Nat. lib. 24. cap. 17. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Magicians</hi> after <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> hath commended the Herb <hi>Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>photis</hi> (which is thought to be the ſame with <hi>Baaras)</hi> ſo call'd for its bright ſhining colour, and that <hi>Magicians</hi> uſe it when they caſt out Devils.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Exorciſt</hi> being come into the Church, and apparell'd according to his Order, and kneeling devoutly before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, he makes the ſign of the Croſs in his fore-head, mouth, and breaſt, ſaying, <hi>Let the ſign of the Croſs</hi> † <hi>be in my fore-head.

               <p>The Prieſt being thus prepared and armed in all points, what is he not able to do? how do the poor Devils quake and tremble at the very ſight of him? But let us come to the bloody skirmiſh, and obſerve the valour of the Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſigns the Demoniack in the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Breast,</hi> with the ſign of the Croſs, ſaying, <hi>Let the Power of the Fa † ther comfort thee.

And here his <hi>Policy</hi> is to be commended, who firſt chains and ſhackles theſe wicked Spirits; for having them once faſt bound, he may with more eaſe rule and govern them.

                  <hi>O Lord, expel the Devil from this thy Creature</hi> N. <hi>from his head, from his hair, from the top of his head, from his forehead, from his eyes, from his tongue, from his ears, from his noſtrils, from his nock, from his jaw-bones, from his teeth, from his throat, from his gums, from his mouth, from his palate, from his brain, from his eye-lids, from the hair on his eye-lids, from his feet, from his ſhin-bones, from his knees, from his legs, from his privy-members, from his reins, from his ſides, from his inward parts both above and below, from his thigh, from his belly, from his ſtomack, from his heart,</hi>

                  <hi>from his ſhoulders, from his breaſt, from his paps, from his arms, from his hands, from his nails, from his bones, from his nerves, from his veins, from his marrow, from his lungs, from the ligaments of his body, from his five ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of body and ſoul, from his whole body both within and without,</hi> &amp;c. Mengus, <hi>p.</hi> 76.</p>
               <p>If the Devils be obſtinate, and will not depart, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> forced for a time to leave off his <hi>Conjuration;</hi> then he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to leave the <hi>Head, Heart,</hi> and <hi>Stomack,</hi> and deſcend to the inferior parts of his body, <hi>viz.</hi> the dead Nails of his feet, <hi>Meng.</hi> p. 197.</p>
               <p>'Tis confidently affirm'd of the Fox, that being troubled with Fleas, he gets a lock of Wool in his mouth, and goes into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by a gradual immerſion forceth them into the upper parts of his body, his neck and head, and at laſt into the lock of Wool, which, popping his head under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he parts with, and ſo frees himſelf from thoſe troubleſome Companions. How eaſily might the Prieſt, when he hath the Devils lodg'd in the dead parts of the Nails, take his knife and pare them off, and ſo prevent the trouble and hazard of a ſecond Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p> 5. The Prieſt takes the Image of the Devil that troubles the poſſeſſed, painted on a paper, with his Name written at the head of it; and having firſt conjur'd the Fire, and caſt into it conſecrated <hi>Sulphur, Galbanum, Aſſa foetida, Ariſtolochia, Yperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, &amp; Ruta;</hi> he holds this painted Image over it; and, having read a long <hi>Adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which is too long to be inſerted) he caſteth the Image into the fire; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the Devil, ſaith, <q>Let all thy cogitations turn to thy detriment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, O curſed Spirit, to the praiſe of God, and thy terrible puniſhment, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal malediction, and thy preſent expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of this Creature of God <hi>N.</hi> And as this fire burns thy Name and Image; ſo mayeſt thou (O curſed Spirit) feel in thy ſelf a thouſandfold greater pains, and let them be augmented till the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Meng.</hi> p. 153, 157, 161.</q>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <q>O unclean Spirit, I exorciſe thee by the Living † God, by the True † God, by the Holy † God, who made Heaven and Earth; That all the power of the Enemy, the whole Hoſt of Satan, and every phantaſm, may be eradicated, and flye away from this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Oil, and all Herbs that are in it, that it may be a flaming fire againſt all the ſnares of the Enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>6. If what hath been done, be not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, then the Prieſt flies to his never-failing Remedy, a certain <hi>Potion.</hi> And though ſome men induſtriouſly conceal what hath coſt them much pains and ſtudy (though it be eminently uſeful and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to others); yet theſe Gentlemen are not more happy in diſcovering, than chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in communicating Secrets that may be beneficial to Mankind; and particularly this excellent <hi>Recipe,</hi> which they ſay muſt be made after this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Take a pound or two of Veal, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fleſh in ſeaſon, and boil it well without Salt; then take ſix or eight ounces of the Broth, firſt conſecrated by the Prieſt, and put into it two ounces of conſecrated Oil, and when they are well mixed, give it warm to the Patient or Poſſeſſed; but
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48915:139"/> before he take it, let the Prieſt give him a piece of conſecrated bread, ſaying <hi>Take this bread for the deſtruction of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments and wicked works of Satan. In the Name of the Fa</hi> † <hi>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
                  <hi>Mengus,</hi> p. 120, 121.</p>
               <p>Here it may be neceſſary to give the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> one Caution, That he be not ſo unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly as to ask theſe great Maſters, How theſe ſenſible and corporeal things can act upon ſpiritual and immaterial Subſtances? 'Tis enough that they ſay it is ſo. That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are affected, vexed, tormented, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd by natural and corporeal things, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Mengus, Docum.</hi> 3. And <hi>Serarius</hi> tells us, That they do it <hi>efficacia quadante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus naturali,</hi> by an efficiency after a ſort na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <hi>In Tob.</hi> 8. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore ſuppoſe the Devil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of this <hi>Potion,</hi> to be in great pain and torment; and doubtleſs the poor <hi>Fiend</hi> would gladly be gone: But behold, he is chain'd and fetter'd, and cannot depart without licenſe; and another piece of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he muſt do before he can obtain it, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That to the honour of God, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of others, he confeſs ſome Article of the Faith; that in the virtue of that Article he give reverence to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by bending the knee, and bowing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48915:139"/> the head thrice to the ground, in adoration of the moſt Holy Trinity, <hi>Meng. Docum.</hi> 5.</q> Theſe, you'l ſay, are hard terms; but no queſtion the Devil, in this ſad pickle, readily ſubmits to them for eaſe and liberty.</p>
               <p>And now we muſt ſuppoſe the <hi>skirmiſh</hi> over, and this great <hi>Conqueror,</hi> I mean the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> triumphing over his vanquiſht Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and yet 'tis hard to ſay whether of the two is more joyful.</p>
               <p>And what can keep the <hi>Patient</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> from rejoycing with them? Doubtleſs nothing, except the fear of a ſecond <hi>Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> either by this, or ſome other Devil.</p>
               <p>We ſay, <hi>The burnt child dreads the fire;</hi> and this Devil being once delivered from the torments which he lately ſuffered, methinks he ſhould not deſire to return: certainly he will not, if the late <hi>Potion</hi> was but as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him as 'twas to the poor <hi>Demoniack.</hi> Yet leſt he ſhould attempt it, the Prieſt uſeth this dreadful and moſt effectual <hi>Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I conjure you, † O <hi>Air Earth, Water</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> by God the Father Almighty, and by the Angels and Arch-Angels, and by all the Court of Heaven, and by the Merits and Prayers of all Saints, That ye have no power to entertain and keep this curſed and moſt wicked Spirit, but that ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48915:140"/> caſt him out, and all that favour him. And O thou <hi>Hell</hi> and infernal <hi>Fire,</hi> and all you infernal <hi>Devils,</hi> obſerve and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of my mouth. I conjure you by all the <hi>Names</hi> of God, by S. <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord Jeſu Chriſt, by S. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> &amp;c. That ye preſently obey my Commands, and receive and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this wicked Spirit, <hi>Meng.</hi> p. 141—</q>
               </p>
               <p>But though this Devil may be confin'd to the infernal pit, yet by others he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and invaded. Againſt thoſe alſo there's an effectual <hi>Remedy,</hi> which is thus prepared: The Prieſt takes a Paper, and having bleſſed and beſprinkled it with Holy-water, writes upon it theſe words;</p>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:48915:140"/>
               <p> Then he takes exorciſed Salt, ſome Wax of the Paſchal Candle, or any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated VVax, and conſecrated Rue; and having ſprinkled them with Holy water, he wraps them all up in the foreſaid Paper, and hangs them about the neck of the Patient, <hi>Meng.</hi> p. 256, 257. And now I leave him in a tranſport of joy, and bidding defiance to all the Devils in Hell.</p>

               <p>2. The Heathen buried their dead in ſuch Gowns and Garments as were proper to their Places and Offices.

The <hi>Paludamentum</hi> was proper to the Lord General, or the chief Captains. The <hi>Toga picta</hi> was worn by Emperors in their Triumphs.

               </p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Romans</hi> were burnt, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in theſe Gowns proper to their Degrees and Offices, is moſt clear from all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>Thus do our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> offer Gifts and Sacrifices for the dead, the <hi>third, ſeventh—day</hi> after their deceaſe. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath appointed an Office for the dead on theſe days; in which we have this Prayer:</p>

               <p>I cannot here paſs over in ſilence, the pretty taking Reaſons which their great <hi>Durand</hi> hath given for theſe Obſervations, and their myſtical Significations: <q>Some commemorate the Dead the <hi>third day,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which was on the third day; or to the Trinity; or that their Sins may be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which they, when alive, committed three ways, <hi>viz.</hi> in thought, word, and work. Others obſerve the <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> 1. That the dead may ſooner come to the Sabbath of Eternal Reſt. 2. That all his Sins may be pardon'd that he committed in this life, which is meaſured by <hi>ſeven days.</hi> 3.

               <p>The only doubt is, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which ſeem'd ſo probable to the famous Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> that being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>James,</hi> Whether he thought him ſo to be?

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many of our Divines have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Queſtion Affirmatively, with ſome limitations. Which charitable Conceſſion is groſly abuſed by our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> When they meet with ſome weak and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48915:175"/> Perſons, whom they endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte; the <hi>medium</hi> which they commonly uſe, is this, <hi>That their Religion is the ſafer;</hi> And they prove it thus, <hi>By our Confeſſion, Salvation may be had in their Church; but their Doctors abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This Objection hath been moſt ſolidly confuted by the learned Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in ours; and therefore by the Confeſſion of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they may be ſafe; but of us there's a great queſtion; for none but our ſelves ſay, that we can be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may give the Reader the true ſtate of, and return a full Anſwer to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propounded, I will lay down theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we have great reaſon to think, That many of the <hi>Laity</hi> in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, if not the greateſt number of them, do not cordially embrace many of their Corruptions in <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> nor the moſt dangerous of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe are commonly tainted with ſo much of their Corruptions, as renders their Salvation extreamly hazardous. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 15. <hi>If any man build on this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, wood, hay, ſtubble,—He ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> This Phraſe <hi>[ſo as by fire]</hi> is Proverbial, and notes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream danger a man is in, and yet eſcapes.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48915:175"/> They are not ſaved with leſs danger than the Seven Thouſand were, among the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> of the Ten Tribes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 18; or the <hi>Corites</hi> in the Tents of <hi>Corah</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Num.</hi> 26. 11. 'Twas an extraordinary Mercy that preſerved the one, and, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how, reſcued the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> leaving the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of our Church, doth incur a greater guilt, and conſequently run a greater hazard than one who was bred up in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and continues therein by invincible ignorance. For a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is ſuppos'd to have ſufficient Convictions of the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; or is guilty of wilful Ignorance, if he hath not. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know not what allowance God will make for <hi>invincible Ignorance,</hi> and the impreſſes of Birth and Education; yet we are ſure, that <hi>wilful Ignorance,</hi> or chuſing a worſe Church before a better, is a damnable Sin, and, unrepented of, deſtroys Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we ſay, <hi>That Salvation may be had in the Roman Church;</hi> 'tis grounded on the hopes we conceive of their Repentance, and not the goodneſs of their Religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That man who embraceth Popery in its latitude, that is, the Canons of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> Council, and as they are explicated by many of their greateſt Doctors, and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48915:176"/> whoſe practices exactly correſpond there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, cannot be ſaved: 1. Becauſe he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth damnable Errors, as worſhipping of Images, and the Hoſt in the Sacrament. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Reprobate may do, nay often doth as much, and more than many of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Doctors have placed among the <hi>Agenda</hi> of that Church for the attainment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. I grant, that damnable Errors do no more than damnable Practices, as Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Drunkenneſs—actually damn men; when ſincere Repentance intervenes, this will obtain from God a Pardon of the one, as well as of the other. But the Repentance preſcribed by their Doctors, falls ſo far ſhort of that required by God in his word, that if a man reſt in it (and I fear too many do), he adds Impenitency to his other Crimes, and conſequently is excluded from all hopes of Salvation.</p>
               <p>This will appear, if we remark the nature of that Repentance which (ſay they) is ſufficient to obtain remiſſion of ſin. <q>In the new Law (ſaith <hi>Lay-man)</hi> after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of a mortal ſin, true Contrition is not neceſſary to a man who is about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament of Penance; but At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is ſufficient, though he know it to be no more. And when 'tis ſaid, <hi>That of Attrite, by vertue of the Sacrament, a man</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:48915:176"/> 
                     <hi>is made Contrite;</hi> it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as if the act of Attrition did paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an act of Contrition; but that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by Attrition with the Sacrament of Penance, is as well juſtified, as by Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without it, <hi>Theol. Moral.</hi> lib. 5. tract. 6. cap. 2.</q> And <hi>Fillincius</hi> ſtarting this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <q>Whether Attrition in the Article of Death, be ſufficient with the Sacrament, or a man ought to have Contrition? Anſwers, That according to Divine Juſtice a man that's attrite with the Sacrament, is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be contrite in the Article of Death; and he gives this reaſon, Becauſe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſufficiency of Attrition with the Sacrament, is practically certain accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Council of <hi>Trent, Quaeſt.
